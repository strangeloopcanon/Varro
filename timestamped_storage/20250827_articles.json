      "text": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin slumped to a seven-week low on Tuesday as traders shunned risk after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook deepened worries about the central bank\u2019s independence.\n\nAs of 10:09 ET (14:09 GMT), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency traded 1.9% lower at $110,270, its lowest since July 9.\n\nIt has now retreated nearly 12% from an August record peak above $124,000, erasing much of the rally built on bets the Fed would soon pivot to rate cuts.\n\nTrump on Monday announced he had fired Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, accusing her of misrepresenting home-ownership status in 2021 loan documents.\n\nThe allegations, referred to the Justice Department by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, are disputed by Cook, who said her dismissal was unlawful and undermined the Fed\u2019s political independence, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nThe rare removal of a sitting Fed governor jolted markets, raising fears of political interference in monetary policy. Investors struggled to assess whether the Fed can deliver policy guidance free of political pressure.\n\nThe move follows weeks of Trump criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom he has publicly pressured to cut rates more aggressively.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets are particularly sensitive to shifts in U.S. interest-rate expectations because lower borrowing costs tend to boost demand for speculative assets.\n\nEthereum has rallied sharply and recently hit new record highs, but Standard Chartered says the token and related corporate treasuries remain undervalued.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research, noted that treasury companies and ETFs have absorbed nearly 5% of ETH in circulation since June, pushing the price to an all-time high on August 24.\n\nHe argued that \u201cETH and the ETH treasury companies are cheap at today\u2019s levels\u201d and forecast ETH could reach $7,500 by year-end, with treasury firms potentially owning up to 10% of supply.\n\nKendrick highlighted that firms such as Sharplink (NASDAQ:SBET) and Bitmine (NYSE:BMNR) trade at valuations below MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) , despite benefiting from Ethereum\u2019s staking yield.\n\n\u201cGiven that the ETH treasury companies are able to capture ETH\u2019s 3% staking yield I see no reason for the net asset value (NAV) multiples to be below MSTR\u2019s multiple,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe added that SBET\u2019s buyback pledge sets \u201ca hard floor\u201d for valuations and argued that ETH treasury vehicles have structural advantages over U.S. spot ETH ETFs.\n\nMost altcoins fell sharply on Tuesday in a broad-based sell-off following Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nWorld no. 2 crypto Ethereum dropped 3.6% to $4,470.85, after hitting a record high of $4,955 earlier this week..\n\nWorld no. 3 crypto XRP fell 1.4% to $2.91.\n\nSolana dipped 4.4%, while Cardano slipped 2.5%, and Polygon traded 2.3% lower.\n\nAmong meme tokens, Dogecoin dropped nearly 4%, while $TRUMP retreated 1.9%.\n\n(Ayushman Ojha contributed to this report.)",

Since listing on July 22 across MultiBank.io, MEXC, Gate.io, Uniswap, and BingX, $MBG has climbed to seven times its debut price, attracting worldwide attention as one of the market\u2019s most closely followed new assets.\n\nABOUT MULTIBANK GROUP\n\nMultiBank Group, established in California, USA in 2005, is a global leader in financial derivatives.
