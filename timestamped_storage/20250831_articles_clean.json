      "title": "Tories pledge to get 'all our oil and gas out of the North Sea'",
      "clean_text": "Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected. The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on \"maximising extraction\" to get \"all our oil and gas out of the North Sea\" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday, She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up \"paying the price through higher energy bills\". The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: \"We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy.\" Exploring new fields would \"not take a penny off bills\" or improve energy security and would \"only accelerate the worsening climate crisis\", a government spokesperson warned. Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be \"impossible\" by 2050 . Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove. The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage. Badenoch said it was \"absurd\" the UK was leaving \"vital resources untapped\" while \"neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed\". Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to \"drill, baby, drill\" and embark on new oil and gas exploration. It is a reversal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which channelled billions of dollars into clean energy. In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was \"entirely consistent\" with net zero commitments. Since then, major energy companies such as BP have U-turned on the level of investment in renewables to focus on increasing oil and gas production in order to boost profitability. Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, a research and campaign group, said Badenoch's plan was \"reckless\" and would not \"bring down energy bills\". \"These rules are the bare minimum to needed hold the industry to account, and removing them will simply mean more emissions, more environmental harm and more handouts to oil and gas giants at the nation's expense,\" she said. Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected. But Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said scrapping requirements to reduce emissions \"is nothing short of irresponsible environmental vandalism\". He said the UK \"should be setting our sights on leading the world in clean energy, in off shore wind, instead of falling back to a dependency on fossil fuels\". Research shows that 2024 was the first calendar year where the average temperature exceeded 1.5\u00b0C. This made it the hottest year since records began in 1850, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is managed by the European Commission and uses data from the European Union's space programme. The UK was one of 200 countries to sign the Paris Agreement who agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and keep them \"well below\" 2.0C above those recorded in pre-industrial times. Gillian Martin, the Scottish government's energy secretary, said: \"Too many are offering easy answers when what we need are the right answers.\" She said that because the North Sea basin is \"maturing\", the \"responsible approach is to plan now for this eventuality, transitioning to new fuels and sustainable energy in a way that protects our energy security and Scotland's highly skilled",

      "title": "SCO: China and India attempt to repair strained ties",
      "clean_text": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in China on Sunday with the sting of Donald Trump's US tariffs still at the top of his mind. Since Wednesday, tariffs on Indian goods imported into the US, like diamonds and prawns, now stand at 50% \u2013 which the US president says is punishment for Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. Experts say the levies threaten to leave lasting bruises on India's vibrant export sector, and its ambitious growth targets. China's President Xi Jinping, too, is trying to revive a sluggish economy at a time when sky-high US tariffs threaten to derail his plans. Against this backdrop, the leaders of the world's two most populous countries may both be looking for a reset in their relationship, which has previously been marked by mistrust, in large part due to border disputes. \"Put simply, what happens in this relationship matters to the rest of the world,\" Chietigj Bajpaee and Yu Jie of Chatham House wrote in a recent editorial. \"India was never going to be the bulwark against China that the West (and the United States in particular) thought it was... Modi's China visit marks a potential turning point.\" India and China are economic powerhouses \u2013 the world's fifth- and second-largest, respectively. But with India's growth expected to remain above 6% in the coming years, a $4tn (\u00a33tn) economy and $5tn stock market, it is on the way to becoming the third-largest by 2028, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"While the world has traditionally focused on the single most important bilateral relationship in the world, US and China, it is time we shift more focus on how the second and would-be third largest economies, China and India, can work together,\" says Qian Liu, founder and chief executive of Wusawa Advisory, based in Beijing. But the relationship is deeply challenging. The two sides have an unresolved and long-standing territorial dispute that signifies a much broader and deeper rivalry. Violence erupted across Ladakh's Galwan Valley in June 2020 \u2013 the worst period of hostility between the two countries in more than four decades. The fallout was largely economic \u2013 a return of direct flights was taken off the table, visas and Chinese investments were put on hold leading to slower infrastructure projects, and India banned more than 200 Chinese apps, including TikTok. \"Dialogue will be needed to help better manage the expectations of other powers who look to India-China as a key factor of Asia's wider stability,\" says Antoine Levesques, senior fellow for South and Central Asian defence, strategy and diplomacy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. There are other fault lines too, including Tibet, the Dalai Lama, and water disputes over China's plans to build the world's largest hydroelectric power project across a river shared by both nations, as well as tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack. India also does not currently enjoy good relations with most of its neighbours in South Asia, whereas China is a key trading partner for Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. \"I would be surprised if a BYD factory is coming to India, but there may be some soft wins,\" says Priyanka Kishore, founder and principal economist at research company Asia Decoded. It's already been announced that direct flights will resume, there may be more relaxations on visas, and other economic deals. However, the relationship between Delhi and Beijing is \"an uncomfortable alliance to be sure\", notes Ms Kishore. \"Remember at one point, the US and India were coming together to balance China,\" she adds. But India is completely perplexed with the US and its position: \"So it's a smart move \u2013 and feeds into the multipolar narrative that both India and China believe in.\" Modi is travelling to China for the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) - a regional body aimed at projecting an alternative worldview to that of the West. Members include China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Russia. In",

      "title": "The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation",
      "clean_text": "Harold Dillard was 56 when he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer around his abdomen in November 2009. Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan \"Mr Fix It\" type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care. In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. \"His eyes lit up,\" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. \"He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do.\" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away. A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father's head. At the company's warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people. \"All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,\" a detective wrote at the time. Ms Fasold says she imagined her father's body would be handled with respect - but instead it was \"mutilated\", she believes. \"I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn't sleeping.\" The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment. This was Ms Fasold's first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers: private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres. For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes. Although Ms Fasold didn't realise it at the time, her father's case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death. Since at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors. Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600 \"whole-body donations\", and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so. Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says: \"A lot of people are either educated or interested in education.\" But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says; many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free. The Body Shop Conversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West. Like most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled. But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US: a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers, though the firms call themselves \"non-transplant tissue banks\". Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are",
