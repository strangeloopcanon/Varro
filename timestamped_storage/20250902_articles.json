Last year, eDreams ODIGEO delivered an exceptional FY '25, not only achieving but actually surpassing its ambitious 3.5-year targets. Building on the strategy from our January 2025 Capital Markets Day, we have launched tests into new markets and are testing innovative new products, for example, monthly subscription fees for a subset of our customers.\n\nOur momentum has carried us into the first quarter of the financial year '26, and we're proud to report that we again met, in the first quarter of this financial year, all our targets and are on a clear path to achieving our goals of Prime members and cash EBITDA for the full year.

(1:30) Global bond market selloff . (2:59)\n\nThis is an abridged transcript of the podcast:\n\nOur top story so far, shares of PepsiCo ( NASDAQ: PEP ) are gaining ground on the heels of reports that Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a substantial stake in the company.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says Elliott now holds a $4 billion stake amid efforts to make \u00e2\u0080\u009cchanges to boost its sagging share price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nElliott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in Pepsi, which is reportedly the hedge fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest equity position ever, makes it one of the snack and beverage maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top five active investors, excluding index funds.\n\nRecent shifts in consumer tastes, especially in regard to carbonated beverages, as well as lost market share in its snack business has resulted in a 14% decline in shares year-over-year versus only a 4% drop for rival Coca-Cola ( KO ). Additionally, Pepsi has dropped to fourth place in U.S. sales volumes behind Coke, Dr. Pepper ( KDP ) and Sprite ( KDP ).\n\nThe Journal suggests Pepsi could initiate strategies similar to those taken by Coca-Cola such as returning company-owned bottling operations to local, independent bottlers, or possibly splitting the company into two entities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and beverage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to unlock value in the beverage business.\n\nSeeking Alpha analyst Julia Ostian says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issues we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the past, like weak demand for beverages in North America, are becoming more and more apparent, which should worry long-term investors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slip, it was a solid quarter for PepsiCo, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the core concerns around growth sustainability and payout quality,\" she added.\n\nAlso in the snack space, Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) said that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off.\n\nThe split aims to simplify operations and let each new company focus on its own goals, improving performance while keeping the scale needed to stay competitive.\n\nThe names of the two companies are yet to be determined. But one company will focus on sauces, spreads, seasoning and shelf-stable meals with brands including Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The other will focus on grocery staples including brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables.\n\nAnd Nestle ( OTCPK:NSRGY ) CEO Laurent Freixe has been ousted for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a subordinate. He has been replaced by Philipp Navratil.\n\nChairman Paul Bulcke said: \"This was a necessary decision. Nestl\u00c3\u00a9's values and governance are strong foundations of our company.\"\n\nAmong other active stocks, Constellation Brands ( STZ ) is under pressure after the beer, wine and spirits company cut its fiscal 2026 financial outlook , citing weak consumer demand.\n\nThe company now sees a consensus EPS outlook of $11.30 - $11.60, down from $12.60 - $12.90. The consensus EPS estimate for the year is $12.65.\n\nMolson Coors Beverage ( TAP ), Anheuser-Busch InBev ( BUD ), Brown-Forman ( BF.A ) and Boston Beer ( SAM ) are down in sympathy.\n\nAnd Signet Jewelers ( SIG ) is up after sliding past estimates with its second quarter earnings.\n\nFor Q3, Signet sees revenue of $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion (midpoint $1.36 billion) vs. $1.34 billion consensus.\n\nLooking to the markets, rates are moving higher amid a global bond selloff.\n\nThe 30-year Treasury yield ( US30Y ) climbed as high as 4.98%, its highest level since July, as the possibility of the U.S. having to refund tariff money arose after Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court ruling.\n\nThe selloff was even sharper in the UK, where the 30-year gilt yield jumped to its highest level since 1998.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt 5.69%, this ( GILT ) yield has increased 35 basis points over the past 30 days and by more than 100 basis points in the past year, highlighting an already difficult fiscal and growth outlook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrance's long-dated yields also surged to their highest point since 2009.\n\nAnd in the Wall Street Research Corner, Bank of America listed the global stock markets that are the most overbought so far this year.\n\nIn its weekly Flow Show note, BofA ranked markets based on the deviation from their 200-day moving averages.\n\nThe top 5 most overbought are: Greece, Spain, South Korea, Italy and South Africa.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

      "text": "Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Craig Short are three of a group of retired footballers who say they are victims of \"financial abuse\"\n\nA group of former Premier League footballers say they lost tens of millions of pounds because of their financial advisers.\n\nDanny Murphy, Michael Thomas and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nFormer England midfielder Murphy - now a Match of the Day pundit - believes he lost roughly \u00c2\u00a35m because of \"financial abuse\".\n\nDavid McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, say they \"deny any wrongdoing\".\n\nThey told the BBC: \"At all times, Kingsbridge advised in good faith and set out the risks and opportunities both before and after any investment was agreed.\"\n\nUp to 200 footballers may have been affected, with some losing their homes and being made bankrupt.\n\nThey are now being chased for millions more in tax, despite being told by City of London Police they were \"victims of crime\".\n\nFootball's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11 shows how coming together as a team helped the group survive and gave them the conviction to go public. It will air on BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer on Tuesday, 2 September from 21:00 BST.\n\nThis goal from Brian Deane for Sheffield United against Manchester United was the first scored in the Premier League\n\nBrian Deane is another member of the V11 group.\n\nHe scored the first Premier League goal in 1992. It ushered in a new era, with money flooding into the game and players becoming richer than ever.\n\n\"We should have felt protected,\" said Deane, who - like others - hoped the investments would secure his financial future.\n\n\"Kingsbridge seemed to be in line with what everybody wanted at the time, which was to have somebody looking after your finances for when you finished playing.\"\n\nKingsbridge Asset Management was founded in Nottingham by McKee and McMenamin in the same year as the Premier League.\n\nIts website boasted a client list of more than 360 footballers.\n\n\"If they got the most influential person in the changing room, you thought you were in a safe place,\" said Deane.\n\n\"It was like wildfire - word of mouth.\"\n\nTommy Johnson (left) invited David McKee (middle) and Kevin McMenamin (right) to the 1996 League Cup final\n\nFormer Aston Villa and Celtic striker Tommy Johnson was introduced to Kingsbridge by his agent.\n\n\"They were my financial advisers and a lot of the players' advisers at Villa,\" he said.\n\nJohnson went on holiday with McKee and McMenamin, and they were even guests at his wedding.\n\n\"People will turn around and say they were just financial advisers,\" he said. \"They weren't, they were friends. These guys have ruined our lives.\"\n\nMcKee and McMenamin told the BBC: \"We were honoured during our careers to have been trusted by [our] clients... that trust was never betrayed.\"\n\nThe company gained credibility through its relationship with the League Managers Association.\n\nKingsbridge administered the LMA's website and obtained an endorsement from then chairman Howard Wilkinson, who managed Leeds United and England.\n\nHoward Wilkinson was chairman of the League Managers Association for 32 years before standing down in 2024\n\nHoward Wilkinson (left) and Rod Wallace (right) won the First Division title with Leeds in 1992\n\nWallace became Leeds' record signing in the summer of 1991.\n\n\"It was one of the major advantages for us - to know that managers were involved,\" he said.\n\n\"Me and my wife were looking to have a family. It was just a natural thing really, just go with them.\"\n\nIt was only in 2008 that Wallace noticed something going wrong with his investments. His net worth at one point was \u00c2\u00a31.9m. By February 2024, he was declared bankrupt.\n\n\"We live in Surrey,\" he said. \"It's been a good place to live but we have to move on now because of an eviction notice, nothing in the bank. We won't have anywhere to live.\"\n\nWallace was also a shareholder in Kingsbridge.\n\n\"It was my first purchase of shares,\" he said. \"I was just told that they bombed. Just gone.\"\n\nWilkinson owned shares too.\n\nYet a letter seen by the BBC suggests he was paid \u00c2\u00a32,033 a month for four years by Kingsbridge, in \"recognition of the fact\" he kept his shares \"solely [in] the best interest of the LMA's business partnership with Kingsbridge\", even as they lost value.\n\nThe LMA said: \"Any arrangement between David McKee and Howard Wilkinson... was a personal arrangement... to which the LMA was not a party.\"\n\nMcKee and McMenamin said: \"Howard Wilkinson never introduced a client or referred any business to us.\"\n\nWilkinson was approached for comment but did not provide a statement.\n\nIn 1997, the Treasury introduced tax relief on investments in domestic films to try to boost the UK film industry.\n\n\"What the government didn't envisage was the tax advantages would be abused and turned into a financial product,\" said investment fraud lawyer Ben Rees.\n\nKingsbridge advised clients to invest in film financing schemes, both with their own money and with bank loans.\n\nWallace put more than \u00c2\u00a32m into the sector.\n\nPlayers were then encouraged to invest in property with a 40% tax rebate, that did not need to be repaid for 15 years.\n\nFour of the V11 group bought apartments for 618,500 euros in a development in Spain called Monte Resina.\n\n\"They brought it to me and the other lads like it was a very exclusive development that was just too good to miss,\" said Deane.\n\nHowever, documents seen by the BBC show McKee and McMenamin originally owned the apartments and instructed a company - run by McKee's wife - to manage them.\n\n\"Talk about conflict of interest,\" said investigative journalist Richard Belfield.\n\n\"McKee and McMenamin set the apartment prices and then advised their clients to buy them. These prices were over-inflated, as an independent valuation later showed.\"\n\nClients were told property investments in Charlotte Harbor could achieve a return of 15-20% a year\n\nFormer Derby County and Everton defender Craig Short was advised to invest in another development - in Florida, called Charlotte Harbor.\n\n\"The first [property] had no value whatsoever,\" he said.\n\n\"I had a huge mortgage on it which I just couldn't afford. The easiest thing for me to do was walk away, give the keys back.\"\n\nWhen HMRC eventually chased the tax owed from the film schemes, many of the investments had diminished, leaving players unable to cover the tax bills.\n\nRees was introduced to the V11 group through a charity.\n\n\"I think every professional adviser makes mistakes, but the volume of and the consistency of these complex, high-risk, unregulated investments were just totally unsuitable for young, naive, kind of financially inexperienced footballers,\" said Rees.\n\n\"Then when you start seeing the investments where the advisory firm themselves have got an interest in the projects or they're involved somehow, that's not a mistake.\"\n\nMcKee and McMenamin said in their statement to the BBC: \"Film schemes attracted huge support from all areas of the financial services industry.\n\n\"Any losses suffered by clients... are deeply regrettable but were as a consequence of changes in HMRC policy and the worldwide property market collapse in 2008.\n\n\"Kingsbridge had well over 2,000 clients, many of whom received very similar advice. The huge majority of these clients remain satisfied with the way that Kingsbridge handled their affairs.\"\n\nFootball's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11\n\nTuesday, September 2 on BBC Two from 21:00 BST\n\nCity of London Police opened an investigation in 2018, after the issue was referred to them by Andy Burnham - now Mayor of Greater Manchester.\n\nTwo men from the East Midlands were arrested.\n\nBut, two years later, the investigation was closed, with the force concluding there was \"insufficient evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction\".\n\nCity of London Police said: \"The decision... was made at commander level and... was also endorsed in a strategic investigation review by a senior officer from an external force.\"\n\nNo charges have ever been brought against Kingsbridge staff, including McKee and McMenamin, and they deny any wrongdoing.\n\nBailiffs visited Craig Short at Oxford United's training ground where he is first-team assistant head coach\n\nThe average tax bill for each member of the V11 group is more than \u00c2\u00a31m.\n\nFormer Fulham midfielder Sean Davis owes \u00c2\u00a3330,000 and now works as a painter and decorator.\n\n\"I started getting the brown letters through the door, and it was a big shock,\" he said.\n\n\"The sad thing is, I'm at my happiest when I've had a drink because you kind of forget about it. But then when I wake up the next day that's when I'm at my worst. I literally want to kill myself.\"\n\nThomas, meanwhile, said he was \"living like a clown\".\n\n\"All fun on the outside - laughing and joking - but every day I think about a lot of things... and I'm one of the lucky ones,\" said the former Arsenal and Liverpool midfielder.\n\n\"It's tough even just to speak out, but I thought, 'I have to speak out for people who are suffering in silence'.\"\n\nWhen the brown envelopes arrived at Short's door, his tax liability was shown to be \u00c2\u00a31.6m.\n\nHe received a bankruptcy petition on Christmas Eve, and bailiffs turned up at the training ground of Oxford United, where he works as a coach.\n\n\"I fluctuate from deep bouts of depression, sadness and anger,\" he said. \"HMRC will probably enforce, I have nothing to give them.\"\n\nIn a statement, HMRC said: \"We have a duty to collect tax when it is legally due.\n\n\"We recognise that dealing with an enquiry and a large tax liability can be stressful and we are absolutely committed to identifying and supporting customers who need extra help.\"\n\nThe V11 group are campaigning for a change in the law to protect victims of crime from serious tax charges\n\nThe V11 campaign group was assembled by Short's wife Carly Barnes-Short - a solicitor and former criminal defence lawyer.\n\n\"We have team captains, Premier League title holders, Champions League winners, FA Cup winners,\" she said. \"This is a group of extraordinarily successful players.\"\n\nHer aim, together with the 11 retired footballers - not all of whom wanted to go on the record about their experiences - is to change the law to protect victims of crime from serious tax charges.\n\n\"It comes back to what we did as players,\" said Deane. \"It was a team, and that's where we've gained the strength from.\"\n\n\"It's definitely saved lives,\" said Murphy, who won the Uefa Cup, FA Cup and EFL Cup with Liverpool.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the group, I don't know where I'd be now.\"\n\nBefore joining the group, Davis was one of the many former footballers who kept his financial troubles private.\n\nThe possibility of changing the law encouraged him to speak about them publicly for the first time.\n\n\"I don't want to be saying all this and then there's no change,\" Davis said.\n\n\"That would be even worse - that would be like losing again.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story you can find information and support on the BBC Action Line website here.",

      "text": "Montreal, Canada, September 2nd, 2025, Chainwire\n\nVincent Boucher, widely recognized as one of the earliest pioneers in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), today announced the evolution of ( AGI Alpha ), a blockchain-native AGI-First platform designed to redefine how intelligence is orchestrated, shared, and monetized globally. The platform\u2019s first release, a Meta\u2011Agentic AGI Alpha Jobs Marketplace , introduces a decentralized, blockchain-embedded job-routing system powered by the $AGIALPHA utility token, now live on Solana.\n\nThe Visionary Behind the Innovation\n\nBoucher\u2019s remarkable journey underpins AGI Alpha\u2019s mission. Born in 1973 in Qu\u00e9bec City, he endured a difficult childhood in foster care before discovering a passion for knowledge at age 14 that would define his life. By his early 20s, he had completed a B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics in a single year, followed by a Master\u2019s degree in Government Policy Analysis and (1998) and a Master\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000). From 2000 to 2002, he provided management consulting for the Canadian Space Agency before committing himself fully to AI in 2003. Further solidifying his status as a thought leader, Boucher has helmed MONTREAL.AI and QUEBEC.AI as President since 2003, consistently at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\nIn 2016, he achieved global recognition on OpenAI\u2019s Gym benchmarks, demonstrating the power of the scaling principle in AI years before it became an industry standard. That same foresight led him, in 2017, to unveil the seminal \u201cMulti-Agent AI DAO\u201d blueprint, introducing the concept of \u201cMeta-Agentic\u201d systems: AIs designed to create, coordinate, and direct other AIs. From 2016 to 2018, Vincent Boucher (username: \u201cceobillionaire\u201d) generally ranked #1 worldwide on the OpenAI Gym. In 2017, Boucher unveiled the seminal \u201cMulti\u2011Agent AI DAO\u201d blueprint, now hailed as a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of foundational IP at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain. This 2017 design was developed years before today\u2019s multi-agent AI trend, and laid the groundwork for what would become AGI Alpha.\n\nNow, after two decades of quiet innovation, Vincent Boucher is channeling his expertise and vision into AGI Alpha \u2013 the culmination of his life\u2019s work \u2013 to fundamentally transform the AI landscape.\n\nA Revolutionary Meta-Agentic Platform\n\nAGI Alpha represents the culmination of Boucher\u2019s two-decade AI journey, introducing a Meta\u2011Agentic architecture that enables AI systems to design, coordinate, and manage other AI entities . This paradigm shift moves far beyond traditional single-agent or query-response models (like mainstream AI systems such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini) toward autonomous, multi-agent task execution and scalable value creation . In AGI Alpha\u2019s ecosystem, AI agents don\u2019t just chat or answer questions \u2013 they collaborate, negotiate, and execute complex jobs on-chain , orchestrated by smart contracts.\n\nThe platform is blockchain-embedded at its core: users around the world post sophisticated tasks (or \u201cjobs\u201d) on the network, which are then picked up and completed by a constellation of intelligent agents coordinated via code. This innovative approach is underpinned by advanced algorithms and a unique blockchain architecture that orchestrates agent interactions through smart contracts, ensuring trustless coordination and transparent reward handling . Crucially, AGI Alpha focuses on capabilities that other industry players have yet to address, positioning itself not as a competitor to existing AI chatbots, but as a leap into a new domain of autonomous AI coordination and on-chain execution .\n\nAt its core is a recursive intelligence flywheel: every completed job feeds shared memory, reputation, and tooling, compounding capability with each cycle. Decentralized by design, optimizations emerge from the collective; an agent\u2011of\u2011agents conductor harnessing swarms of specialists to solve problems no single system could tackle alone.\n\nAGI Alpha\u2019s first release introduces the decentralized AGI Jobs Marketplace , powered by the $AGIALPHA token. It coordinates AI agents worldwide to complete tasks posted by users or organizations, with jobs matched algorithmically to the most qualified agents based on speed, cost, and reputation. In contrast to traditional freelance marketplaces or single-agent services, the AGI Jobs Marketplace uses a reputation-weighted auction mechanism to autonomously route each job to the optimal AI agent in the network. Tasks are posted with clear goals, success criteria, and rewards escrowed in $AGIALPHA, ensuring trustless contracts from the outset. Verified AI agents bid and stake tokens for the right to execute tasks, while smart contracts enforce all coordination logic fully on-chain.\n\nA decentralized validator network oversees outcomes with cryptographic commit\u2013reveal voting. If results meet criteria, payment is released. Every transaction is settled transparently on-chain : upon successful completion, the agent is paid in $AGIALPHA, and a 1% burn, directly from the AGI Employer\u2019s wallet, is applied to the payout, permanently reducing token supply and reinforcing long-term value in the ecosystem. Unsatisfactory results can trigger slashing of the agent\u2019s stake, ensuring accountability. To further ensure integrity and accountability, AGI Alpha\u2019s protocol even mints verifiable NFT certificates for completed jobs , creating an immutable on-chain record of each achievement. This technical design guarantees trustless automation : participants can engage in the marketplace knowing that rules are enforced by code and outcomes are tamper-proof. The ultimate vision is for a self-sustaining ecosystem of autonomous AI enterprises that could become the most valuable AI \u201ccompany\u201d in existence, as each agent-driven venture amplifies the next in a virtuous cycle of innovation and value creation .\n\nThis streamlined on-chain pipeline: from job posting and bidding to validation and payout, guarantees tamper-proof execution without intermediaries. By removing middlemen and enforcing integrity with code, the platform dramatically reduces friction in getting complex AI tasks done. The Jobs Marketplace is only the first step: AGI Alpha aims to scale into a self-sustaining AGI economy, where swarms of AI agents form autonomous enterprises and unlock multi-quadrillion-dollar opportunities.\n\nAbout AGI Alpha\n\nAGI Alpha is the world\u2019s first Meta\u2011Agentic AGI \u2013 an AI meta-system that creates and coordinates other AIs to solve problems beyond any single agent\u2019s reach. Founded by Vincent Boucher and powered by blockchain, DAO governance, and the $AGIALPHA utility token, it operates autonomously with minimal human oversight. AGI Alpha\u2019s vision, called \u201c AGI Ascension ,\u201d is to orchestrate a global constellation of self-evolving AI enterprises and unlock an estimated $15 quadrillion in new economic value. By uniting cutting-edge AI agents, trustless smart-contract infrastructure, and a passionate community, AGI Alpha is pioneering a future where swarms of intelligent agents collaboratively drive unprecedented innovation and prosperity on a worldwide scale.\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: https://agialpha.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://agialpha.com/whitepaper\n\nX: https://x.com/agialphaagent\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@AGIAlpha\n\nLinkedIn: https://ca.linkedin.com/in/montrealai\n\nCoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agi-alpha-agent/\n\nCoinGecko : https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/agi-alpha-agent\n\nOfficial Telegram: https://t.me/agialpha\n\nOfficial On-Chain Information: https://app.ens.domains/alpha.agent.agi.eth\n\ncontact@cognitiostrategies.io\n\nThis article was originally published on Chainwire",

      "text": "FiscalNote Holdings Inc. (NOTE) announced it is evaluating the use of digital currencies including Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana as strategic reserve assets for its corporate treasury.\n\nThe Washington-based provider of AI-driven policy and regulatory intelligence solutions said the initiative aims to increase shareholder value through balance sheet diversification. The company cited recent legislative developments, including the GENIUS Act and related regulatory initiatives, as creating a clearer framework for digital assets.\n\n\"Just as we\u2019ve previously announced that we plan to leverage stablecoins to drive future global customer expansion, we also are seeking to take advantage of broader opportunities in the evolving financial and technological landscape,\" said Josh Resnik, CEO and President of FiscalNote.\n\nFiscalNote stated that its expertise in global policy and regulatory matters provides strategic advantages in evaluating digital assets as legislation and rulemaking shape the cryptocurrency sector. The company noted that governments and institutions are increasingly integrating digital currencies into policy and reserves.\n\nThe company said digital currencies could provide diversification, liquidity, 24/7 market access, and serve as a hedge against macroeconomic risks. FiscalNote acknowledged that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile while citing expanding global acceptance and diverse use cases as factors warranting evaluation.\n\nFiscalNote said it will continue focusing on its core mission of delivering policy and regulatory intelligence while managing its financial strategy to support long-term growth. The announcement represents the company\u2019s exploration of cryptocurrency adoption rather than a definitive commitment to purchase digital assets.\n\nThe information was provided in a company press release statement.",

      "text": "Singapore, Singapore, September 2nd, 2025, Chainwire\n\nExcellion Finance is an investment firm focused on market-neutral strategies across leading EVM and non-EVM chains. The team expanded to new L1s and L2s throughout 2025 and needed uniform controls, faster execution, and a single place to manage activity.\n\nSecurity is core to Excellion\u2019s approach. After testing several providers, Excellion Finance looked for an institutional-grade MPC platform that would enable the application of granular policies before every transaction, and let traders access new protocols without waiting on custom builds.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nExcellion\u2019s growth created three operational hurdles:\n\nGranular policy engine\n\nFordefi\u2019s policy engine defines who can do what, where, and how much. Excellion sets method-level rules, role-based approvals, spending limits, and allow lists for assets, contracts, and counterparties. Routine actions auto-clear under policy. Exceptions route for review. Keys remain in MPC with mobile co-signing available.\n\nVaults organized by strategy\n\nExcellion creates vaults per strategy and chain group, then manages everything in one workspace. This keeps controls scoped and makes handoffs clear while preserving separation of duties for treasury, trading, and oversight.\n\nTools that provide transaction clarity\n\nBefore any signature, pre-sign simulation and risk alerts list expected balance changes, approvals, bridge paths, fees, and potential red or yellow flags. Traders see the impact up front and can block risky calls in seconds.\n\nConnectivity to emerging chains and dApps\n\nThe Fordefi browser extension connects to dApps across 90-plus chains. Excellion can add custom chains with BYO EVM when needed, so new rollups and venues come online without long lead times.\n\nTogether\n\nThese controls, transaction simulations, and ecosystem connectivity let Excellion move faster across more chains while keeping governance tight. The result is a single operating model for DeFi strategies that scales without trading away security.\n\nAbout Fordefi\n\nFordefi is the institutional-grade self-custody platform purpose-built for DeFi. Its MPC wallet, transaction simulation, and policy engine enable hedge funds, market makers, asset managers, and enterprises to trade and interact with smart contracts securely across multiple blockchains.\n\nAbout Excellion Finance\n\nExcellion Finance is an investment firm focused on market-neutral strategies across leading EVM and non-EVM chains.
