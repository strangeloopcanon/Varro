      "title": "Russia launches massive attack on Ukraine, as Kyiv hits oil refineries",
      "clean_text": "Russia has carried out a massive overnight attack on 14 regions of Ukraine, authorities have said, as Kyiv struck Russian oil refineries. One woman was killed in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and 30 people were injured - including children - according to local officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, urging tough new sanctions on Moscow. Following the attack, Russia's defence ministry said all \"targets of the strike have been achieved\" and \"designated objects have been hit\" - a claim that has not been independently verified. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The latest barrage comes amid ongoing international efforts to secure a peace deal between the two warring nations - and days after the Ukrainian capital Kyiv faced the second largest aerial attack of the war so far, with at least 25 killed. In the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, top official Serhiy Lysak reported a number of strikes on infrastructure facilities and after a \"massive\" drone and missile overnight attack. In the regional capital Dnipro, a residential house was completely destroyed and a shopping centre was damaged, Lysak said. No casualties were reported in the overnight strikes, but Lysak later said four people were injured in a Russian drone attack on Saturday afternoon. It is the second successive night Dnipropetrovsk has been targeted. Earlier this week, Kyiv acknowledged that Russia's military had entered the region and was trying to establish a foothold. Railway infrastructure was damaged near the capital, Kyiv, but it was central and south-eastern Ukraine that bore the brunt of the latest strikes. Emergency services were seen putting out fires in Zaporizhzhia, while explosions were heard in the central eastern regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said its drones hit oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran in Russia overnight. Both refineries have been targeted before. The Ukrainian military said there had been \"numerous\" explosions and fires recorded at the facility in Krasnodar, which Kyiv said produces three million tons of petroleum products per year. The military also reported a fire at the Syzran facility, which it said produced eight-and-a-half million tons of petroleum products annually. Russian authorities in Krasnodar acknowledged the drone strikes had hit its oil refinery. They said one of the process units was damaged and a fire occurred in the area, adding that there had been no casualties. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 18 over the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Moscow annexed in 2014. The Russian military also said it captured Komyshevakha, a rural settlement in the eastern Donetsk region, on Saturday morning. Ukraine has not confirmed this. In recent months, Russian troops have continued their slow advance in eastern Ukraine, despite heavy combat casualties being reported. The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that his forces were continuing \"their non-stop offensive along almost the entire line of contact\". Friday night's aerial exchange follows US-led diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the war, which so far remain at a standstill. Zelensky said the latest attacks showed Russia's \"disregard for words\", adding that the only way to deal with Russia was to impose sanctions. \"We expect action from the US, Europe and the entire world,\" he said. European foreign affairs ministers are in Denmark this weekend to discuss international developments - including the war in Ukraine. One of the key issues on the table is the possibility of freezing approximately \u20ac210bn (\u00a3182bn; $245bn) worth of Russian assets. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who is at the gathering, said it was clear \"Russia does not want peace\" despite diplomatic efforts. France would use the gathering to table new proposals for sanctions against Russia, with the aim of",

      "title": "Trump tariffs: What happens next after court rules them illegal?",
      "clean_text": "A federal appeals court has ruled that most of Donald Trump's tariffs are an overreach of his use of emergency powers as president. The so-called reciprocal tariffs - imposed on nearly every country the US trades with - are being illegally imposed, the US Court of Appeals said on Friday. The decision upholds a ruling in May from the Court of International Trade, which also rejected Trump's argument that his global tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act. Many of the tariffs that would be affected by the ruling stem from an announcement in April of a flat 10% rate on imports from all countries, which Trump said would even out \"unfair\" trade relations with the US. The court did not halt the tariffs but instead said they would remain in place until mid-October, setting up a further legal challenge in the US Supreme Court. There are still a lot of unknowns, but here's what we understand so far about the ruling - and what it could mean for the US president's flagship policy. In its 7-4 decision, the appellate court backed a lower court's finding that Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs. This was largely because of the law Trump used to justify the policies, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the judges said did not grant \"the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax\". The US Court of Appeals rejected Trump's argument that the tariffs were permitted under his emergency economic powers, calling the levies \"invalid as contrary to law\". Trump immediately criticised the judgement, taking to Truth Social in the hours after it landed to call the appeals court \"highly partisan\" and the ruling a \"disaster\" for the country. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote. The decades-old act, which has repeatedly been deployed by Trump during both his terms in office, grants a US president significant authority to respond to a national emergency or a major threat from overseas. The 1977 law states that a president can pull a number of economic levers \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy\". It's been used by both Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who invoked the act to impose sanctions on Russia after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and then again after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later. But the appeals court stated in its decision that the emergency law \"did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs\". The IEEPA \"neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs\", they said. Trump argued when he unveiled his global tariffs that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency. But the court ruled that imposing tariffs is not within the president's mandate, and \"the power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress\". Outside of being a significant setback to a centrepiece of Trump's agenda, the federal appeals court ruling could have an immediate impact on the US economy, with knock-on effects felt in global markets. Tariffs are taxes companies have to pay for importing certain goods from foreign countries - so they can have an affect on sales and profit margins. \"Businesses are going to be subject to uncertainty,\" Dr Linda Yueh, an economist at Oxford University and the London Business School, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tariffs are aimed at deterring domestic firms from buying foreign goods, in turn affecting international trade. As countries wait to see if the US Supreme Court will take up the case - which seems likely - they could decide to hold off on conducting business with the US. If this happens, Dr Yueh said, it could",

      "title": "Gate Launches GUSD: A Stable Investment Backed by Real-World Assets By Chainwire",
      "clean_text": "Cayman Islands, British Overseas Territories, August 29th, 2025, Chainwire Gate, a leading global digital asset trading platform, officially launched its new investment certificate, GUSD. Supported by real-world assets (RWA) such as U.S. Treasury bonds, GUSD provides users with low-risk, stable investment returns. By leveraging blockchain technology, it brings steady yields of traditional finance into the crypto world, serving as an important bridge between TradFi and DeFi, and offering users a safer, more predictable option for asset allocation. With the launch of GUSD, Gate has fully enabled trading, deposits, withdrawals, and related investment functionalities. Users can directly exchange USDT for GUSD on the spot market, or mint GUSD at a 1:1 ratio using USDT or USDC through Gate\u2019s \"Staking\" page. This allows users to conveniently obtain GUSD whether they wish to trade flexibly in the spot market or generate stable returns through RWA minting. GUSD will also serve as a Unified Account contract margin, supported from day one. As of August 29, 2025, Gate has officially opened trading for major cryptocurrency pairs and Simple Earn flexible savings for GUSD, further expanding its circulation and utility. Meanwhile, Gate Launchpool has officially opened its first GUSD staking pool, allowing users to stake GUSD and share CELB token rewards, with an estimated annualized yield of up to 365%. Additionally, lending, CandyDrop, and other functions for GUSD are gradually being rolled out. Once conditions are met, Gate will also collaborate with quality projects to launch GUSD staking pools, providing additional liquidity incentives to attract market attention. Unlike stablecoins that serve solely as a medium of exchange, GUSD itself is an investment certificate with an appreciation attribute. Its returns are derived from the interest generated by the underlying RWA assets. Users do not need to collect interest daily; instead, they receive both principal and accrued interest upon redemption. For example, if a user mints GUSD with 100 USDT and the accumulated return reaches 20% at redemption, they will receive 120 USDC. This mechanism gives GUSD not only stability but also growth over time. While holding USDT simply preserves value for market transactions, holding GUSD is effectively equivalent to indirectly holding a continuously appreciating portfolio of U.S. Treasury-backed assets. Gate stated that as the product continues to expand, the total fund size of GUSD is expected to exceed $100 million in the near term, establishing a more solid market foundation. The platform will also gradually disclose reserve proofs and cooperation details with custodian institutions, ensuring that users can publicly verify that every GUSD issued is fully backed by real-world assets, guaranteeing 100% reserves. Users redeeming GUSD receive USDC, which can then be converted into USDT or other cryptocurrencies, enhancing the credibility and transparency of the product\u2019s dollar-asset linkage. With over $4 billion in managed investment assets and years of robust compliance and operations, Gate provides strong assurance of GUSD\u2019s security and transparency. Compared with RWA products from leading platforms like Binance, GUSD not only follows the same underlying logic but also offers greater flexibility for users, supporting dual-currency minting with USDT and USDC for easier access worldwide. Gate\u2019s launch of GUSD offers a new solution to the long-standing question of how to achieve stable returns in the crypto world. It transforms stablecoins into a secure, transparent, and sustainable digital investment option. As trading pairs, lending, Simple Earn, and staking scenarios continue to expand, GUSD is poised to become the preferred tool for users seeking to allocate assets and achieve long-term growth. About Gate Gate, founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world\u2019s earliest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform serves over 36 million users with 3,600+",
