Currently, 48 hostages are still held there, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nIsraeli military actions in Gaza have since killed 62,966 people, including at least 18,592 children, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.\n\nThe UN has said Israel has restricted aid, and UN-backed experts have confirmed famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas, with more than half a million people across Gaza facing conditions including starvation.\n\nIsrael, which controls entry of goods into the territory, has denied this report and defended its military operation as a fight against Hamas.\n\nUK leaders have become increasingly critical of Israel's conduct in Gaza.\n\nIn May, the UK suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza \"morally unjustifiable\".\n\nIn recent months, Lammy said he was appalled and sickened by the plight of civilians in Gaza and called on Israel to allow \"unhindered\" aid into Gaza.\n\nThis week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israeli strikes on a hospital that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, were \"completely indefensible\".\n\nAfter the Labour Party came to power last year, it suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences to Israel, but did not include parts for the F-35 jet, which the government said it could not prevent Israel from obtaining as they are sent to manufacturers worldwide.\n\nThese jets have been used extensively in Gaza.\n\nCorrection: This article has been amended to remove an incorrect claim that the Israeli government has a stake in defence firm Elbit Systems",

      "text": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell to around $109,000 on Friday following key U.S. inflation data, though the markets continue to expect a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month, while worries around the central bank\u2019s independence persist.\n\nAs of 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency last traded 3.8% lower at $109,070.0\n\nIt fell to a seven-week low below $109,000 earlier this week, but has rebounded slightly after that.\n\nStill, Bitcoin has fallen more than 10% from an August record peak above $124,000, and was set for its first monthly drop since April.\n\nThe token is poised to fall about 6% in August, after four consecutive monthly gains.\n\nU.S. inflation picked up in July, with the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge showing tariffs are filtering through the economy.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Friday that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy, rose at a 2.9% annual rate, the highest since February and up slightly from June.\n\nOn a monthly basis, core prices climbed 0.3%, while the broader index increased 0.2% for a 2.6% yearly gain\u2014both in line with forecasts.\n\nThe Fed views core PCE as the best guide to underlying inflation.\n\nMarkets still expect policymakers to cut rates again at their meeting next month. Fed Governor Christopher Waller signaled Thursday he would consider a larger reduction if labor data weaken further.\n\nRate cut optimism generally boosts speculative assets like crypto, but President Donald Trump\u2019s attempted firing of Fed Governor Lisa Cook earlier this week dampened risk appetite.\n\nCook refused to resign and filed a lawsuit challenging the move, saying her removal would undermine the Fed\u2019s independence. The rare clash has unsettled investors wary of political influence over monetary policy.\n\nBitcoin often comes under pressure during periods of heightened macroeconomic and political uncertainty, despite being promoted by some investors as a hedge.\n\nAmerican Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining company backed by Donald Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr., aims to start trading on Nasdaq in early September 2025 via a reverse merger with Gryphon Digital Mining,\u00a0according to a Reuters report.\n\nTrump sons and the firm\u2019s largest investor, Hut 8 , collectively control about 98% of the firm, the report said.\n\nAltcoins were largely down on Friday, tracking the declines in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWorld no.2 crypto Ethereum fell over 6% to $4,292.43.\n\nWorld no. 3 crypto XRP declined 5.5% to $2.84.\n\nSolana lost 1.4% to $208.61\n\nCardano fell over 5%, while Polygon traded marginally higher.\n\nAmong meme tokens, Dogecoin slid 4.4%, while $TRUMP slipped 3%.\n\n(Ayushman Ojha contributed to this report.)",

      "summary": "A think tank says a new bank tax could raise \u00a38bn a year, a suggestion that sent bank shares tumbling.",
      "text": "The share prices of leading UK banks have tumbled following calls for the government to introduce a new tax on banking profits.\n\nTraders and investors reacted to suggestions that the government could raise up to \u00a38bn a year with a windfall tax on the sector.\n\nThe proposal comes from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank which argues it is a way to claw back taxpayers' money which is being spent supporting the banking sector.\n\nThe Treasury has not commented on the policy, but concerns led to NatWest, Lloyds and Barclays being the biggest fallers on the main index of the London Stock Exchange early on Friday.\n\nNatWest and Lloyds share prices were down by more than 4% in morning trading, and Barclays had dropped by more than 3%.\n\nCharlie Nunn, the chief executive of Lloyds bank, has previously spoken out against any potential tax rises for banks in the government's Budget announcement this autumn.\n\nHe said efforts to boost the UK economy and foster a strong financial services sector \"wouldn't be consistent with tax rises\".\n\nThe Treasury has been contacted for comment.\n\nThe IPPR, a left-leaning think tank, said a levy on the profits of banks was needed as the Bank of England's quantitative easing ( QE) drive was costing taxpayers \u00a322bn a year.\n\nAfter the financial crisis and in 2020, the Bank of England began buying bonds - essentially IOUs it receives a fixed interest rate for - to support the financial sector and reduce longer term interest rates.\n\nTo buy these bonds, the Bank borrowed money from commercial banks, and those banks are paid interest on those reserves.\n\nWhile the Bank started reversing its QE strategy in 2022, it is still losing money on the programme because the interest rate it pays on reserves has shot up, while the rate it gets from the government bonds it holds has remained the same.\n\nIn addition, the Bank of England is making a loss on unwinding its QE programme as it is selling bonds at a lower price than it paid for them.\n\nThe IPPR said the Bank of England is now making huge losses, which it described as \"a government subsidy to commercial banks\", and highlighted commercial bank profits compared to before the pandemic were up by $22bn.\n\nThe tax suggestion comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the difficult task of meeting her own self-imposed rules on taxation and spending when she sets out her Budget strategy for the next five years.\n\nCarsten Jung, associate director for economic policy at IPPR and former Bank of England economist, said the Bank and Treasury had \"bungled the implementation of quantitative easing\".\n\n\"Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks' coffers because of a flawed policy design,\" he said.\n\n\"While families struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Today programme, Mr Jung said the \u00a322bn taxpayer loss was roughly equivalent to \"the entire budget of the Home Office every year\".\n\n\"So we're suggesting to fix this leak of taxpayer money, and the first step would be a targeted levy on commercial banks that claws back some of these losses,\" he said.\n\nA tax targeting the windfall profits linked to QE would still leave the banks with \"substantially higher profits\", the IPPR report said , while saving the government up to \u00a38bn a year over the term of parliament.\n\nBut financial services body UK Finance said that a further tax on banks would make Britain less internationally competitive.\n\n\"Banks based here already pay both a corporation tax surcharge and a bank levy,\" the trade association said.\n\nThe corporation tax surcharge was introduced by the previous government in 2021, and is an 8% levy on the profits of banks, on top of the standard corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Bank levy, introduced in 2011, is another tax on banks' business activities, but is based on banks' balance sheets, or the scale of their business, rather than profits.\n\nUK Finance said a new tax on banking would \"run counter to the government's aim of supporting the financial services sector\".\n\nRuss Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said the UK stock market had soured following the suggestion, with investors wondering \"if the era of bumper profits, dividends and buybacks is now under threat\".\n\nThe Chancellor has worked hard since Labour won power to woo the City. In her Mansion House speech in November last year, Reeves said that banking regulation after the 2008 financial crisis had \"gone too far\".\n\nBut she is under pressure to find more sources of revenue in the run-up to her budget, after the government watered down its planned welfare savings and largely reversed winter fuel allowance cuts - decisions which narrowed her budget headroom.",

      "summary": "Gate Launches GUSD: A Stable Investment Backed by Real-World Assets",
      "text": "Cayman Islands, British Overseas Territories, August 29th, 2025, Chainwire\n\nGate, a leading global digital asset trading platform, officially launched its new investment certificate, GUSD. Supported by real-world assets (RWA) such as U.S. Treasury bonds, GUSD provides users with low-risk, stable investment returns. By leveraging blockchain technology, it brings steady yields of traditional finance into the crypto world, serving as an important bridge between TradFi and DeFi, and offering users a safer, more predictable option for asset allocation.\n\nWith the launch of GUSD, Gate has fully enabled trading, deposits, withdrawals, and related investment functionalities. Users can directly exchange USDT for GUSD on the spot market, or mint GUSD at a 1:1 ratio using USDT or USDC through Gate\u2019s \"Staking\" page. This allows users to conveniently obtain GUSD whether they wish to trade flexibly in the spot market or generate stable returns through RWA minting. GUSD will also serve as a Unified Account contract margin, supported from day one. As of August 29, 2025, Gate has officially opened trading for major cryptocurrency pairs and Simple Earn flexible savings for GUSD, further expanding its circulation and utility. Meanwhile, Gate Launchpool has officially opened its first GUSD staking pool, allowing users to stake GUSD and share CELB token rewards, with an estimated annualized yield of up to 365%. Additionally, lending, CandyDrop, and other functions for GUSD are gradually being rolled out. Once conditions are met, Gate will also collaborate with quality projects to launch GUSD staking pools, providing additional liquidity incentives to attract market attention.\n\nUnlike stablecoins that serve solely as a medium of exchange, GUSD itself is an investment certificate with an appreciation attribute. Its returns are derived from the interest generated by the underlying RWA assets. Users do not need to collect interest daily; instead, they receive both principal and accrued interest upon redemption. For example, if a user mints GUSD with 100 USDT and the accumulated return reaches 20% at redemption, they will receive 120 USDC. This mechanism gives GUSD not only stability but also growth over time. While holding USDT simply preserves value for market transactions, holding GUSD is effectively equivalent to indirectly holding a continuously appreciating portfolio of U.S. Treasury-backed assets.\n\nGate stated that as the product continues to expand, the total fund size of GUSD is expected to exceed $100 million in the near term, establishing a more solid market foundation. The platform will also gradually disclose reserve proofs and cooperation details with custodian institutions, ensuring that users can publicly verify that every GUSD issued is fully backed by real-world assets, guaranteeing 100% reserves. Users redeeming GUSD receive USDC, which can then be converted into USDT or other cryptocurrencies, enhancing the credibility and transparency of the product\u2019s dollar-asset linkage.\n\nWith over $4 billion in managed investment assets and years of robust compliance and operations, Gate provides strong assurance of GUSD\u2019s security and transparency. Compared with RWA products from leading platforms like Binance, GUSD not only follows the same underlying logic but also offers greater flexibility for users, supporting dual-currency minting with USDT and USDC for easier access worldwide.\n\nGate\u2019s launch of GUSD offers a new solution to the long-standing question of how to achieve stable returns in the crypto world. It transforms stablecoins into a secure, transparent, and sustainable digital investment option. As trading pairs, lending, Simple Earn, and staking scenarios continue to expand, GUSD is poised to become the preferred tool for users seeking to allocate assets and achieve long-term growth.\n\nAbout Gate\n\nGate, founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world\u2019s earliest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform serves over 36 million users with 3,600+ digital assets and pioneered the industry\u2019s first 100% proof-of-reserves. Beyond core trading services, Gate\u2019s ecosystem includes Gate Wallet, Gate Ventures, and other innovative solutions, while its global partnerships extend to top-tier sports brands like Oracle Red Bull Racing in F1 and Inter.\n\nFor more information, users can visit: Website | X | Telegram | LinkedIn | Instagram | YouTube\n\nDisclaimer :\n\nThis content does not constitute an offer, solicitation, or recommendation.

      "text": "Investing.com --\u00a0Ethereum\u2019s recent surge relative to Bitcoin is attracting the attention of cross-asset analysts, with the latest Sevens Report warning that the long-ETH/short-BTC trade may carry signals for equity markets.\n\n\u201cSince early July, a noteworthy dynamic began to emerge in relative performance between Bitcoin and its distant second most-popular \u2018crypto cousin,\u2019 Ethereum,\u201d Sevens said.\n\nEthereum has \u201cmeaningfully outperformed Bitcoin with the Long-ETH/Short-BTC trade accelerating rapidly as both cryptos surged towards record highs.\u201d\n\nSevens noted that while many traditional investors might dismiss the shift, \u201cthere is a key underlying takeaway sourced in cross-asset analysis.\u201d\n\nHistorically, sharp ETH/BTC rallies have coincided with \u201csqueezy yet powerful rallies in equity markets preceding near-term blowoff tops in the broader stock market.\u201d\n\nThe firm noted that examples include the ETH/BTC rally of 2017 that preceded double-digit equity drawdowns in 2018, a 2020 move ahead of the pandemic selloff, and a surge in 2021 that foreshadowed the \u201cDouble Bear Market\u201d of 2022.\n\nMore recently, the current \u201c130% rally in ETH/BTC off of the 5-year lows reached in April\u2026has obviously coincided with the resilient tech-led rally in stocks off the 2025 lows,\u201d the note said.\n\nSevens highlighted that the present situation differs from 2023\u20132024, when Ethereum lagged while stocks posted gains. The firm cautioned that the ETH/BTC uptrend \u201cis poised to be tested in the sessions ahead\u201d and warned that \u201conce the upside momentum faded from ETH/BTC rally, it would have been prudent for equity investors to put their guard up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBottom line, in prior cases over the last 10 or so years, every time we have seen such a robust and pronounced rise in the ETH/BTC crypto-pair, stocks have been sprinting higher in lockstep. However, once the upside momentum faded from ETH/BTC rally, it would have been prudent for equity investors to put their guard up,\u201d Sevens said.",
