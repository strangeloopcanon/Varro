      "text": "Sergo2/iStock via Getty Images\n\nSergo2/iStock via Getty Images\n\nListen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify\n\nJobs data and politicized rate cuts (0:25) Gold highs, silver surging (2:10) Retail earnings a mix (3:25) Google and how AI is hitting bottom lines (6:45)\n\nTake today's Investment News Quiz!\n\nTranscript\n\nRena Sherbill: Brian Stewart, Seeking Alpha's Director of news, welcome back to Wall Street Roundup.\n\nBrian Stewart: Great to be here.\n\nRS: Set the stage for us. What's top of mind for you as we start September, a shortened trading week? Talk to us.\n\nBS: If we're talking themes, I think, the jobs data is coming out. We're recording this Thursday, so listeners will probably have a little bit more information than we do right now about what the jobs data is gonna say.\n\nThat puts into the frame of the Federal Reserve. Currently, there's a 97% chance, according to the FedWatch tool, that the Fed's going to cut rates in September.\n\nThat's been inching higher recently. So it was kind of in the mid eighties as of last week, but has now kind of reached the the level of in that inevitability.\n\nObviously, the idea of a rate cut has become highly politicized. The Fed is basically at war with the president. So maybe having this cut happen might relieve some of that tension, that might give markets a little relief, not to mention the relief that's gonna come with the idea that their rates are gonna be lower.\n\nOne issue though is the inflation statistics remain kind of unmovable. You haven't seen those metrics show much relief. You're seeing inflation in the PCE last week showing just under 3%, 2.9 annual growth.\n\nNext week, we got CPI coming out, probably gonna show something very similar. So you see the Fed facing the sticky inflation with the tariff impact still TBD.\n\nMeanwhile, the jobs data has started to underwhelm to the point where rate cuts are becoming inevitable. So that tension's going to be critical for the next couple weeks.\n\nRS: And anything you would mention as we talk about governments and monetary policy, it makes me think of the record prices that gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has been hitting, silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) has been surging.\n\nHow much are you looking at the precious metal sector, the bond sector perhaps?\n\nBS: It's interesting to to think about the two high profile parts of the market right now remain AI and gold, which seem very far removed in terms of the usual constituencies for those investments.\n\nSo it's kind of interesting that that's where we're at, where you have an inflation hedge that's become very popular as a place to store money for many investors.\n\nMeanwhile, people are still making bets in the AI space, hoping that'll be the engine for the market to go higher.\n\nAnd meanwhile, you have kind of this middle ground where most of equities are falling, where it's more a stock picker kind of situation.\n\nSo I do think that's something to keep an eye on, is the further activity in the gold market because I think that'll give a great sign of what people feel about inflation.\n\nRS: And earnings wise this week, what were you focused on?\n\nBS: So there were a lot of retailers that came out and it was kind of a interesting mix there. You had Macy's ( M ) which which popped after its earnings. Investors seeing signs of a turnaround there.\n\nIts stock rose 21% after its earnings, is up 71% from its April lows. April was when the worst of the tariff fears hit the retail sector, which was one of the hardest hit areas, with that scare. It's still off a fifty two week high though.\n\nIt reached its fifty two week high late last year, so it needs another 8% to get up there. The company said that it faced tariff headwinds, but saw sales improvement for its luxury brands like Bloomingdale's.\n\nSo you see there may be a worry that the higher prices, both from underlying inflation and the tariffs are going to cut into consumer spending, especially on the low end where people have less resources.\n\nMeanwhile, you might find some winners in the luxury space because those brands are more capable of eating some of the tariffs and maybe holding prices steady and the customers have more money, so maybe they're not as impacted by those price changes.\n\nThat's underlined by what we saw from Dollar Tree ( DLTR ). Dollar Tree was down 9% following its earnings. It initially ticked higher after its earnings were released but turned into decline as people metabolize the guidance.\n\nThat had a very significant tariff impact and you can see where that would work out. If you're the kind of store that's operating on the low end of the price spectrum, you're getting a lot of your goods from overseas where you're taking advantage of cheap labor.\n\nNow those prices are are being hit by tariffs. You're seeing a large percentage increase in those prices as compared to the percentage increase you might see in a $400 handbag or something like that.\n\nYou're starting to really cut into your customer's ability to buy more stuff. So you kinda see that bifurcation happening.\n\nAnother interesting retail story was American Eagle ( AEO ) up 26% after its earnings. This is an example of another company that's been politicized lately. They had their Sydney Sweeney campaign, which stirred some controversy, and now that was a big success, apparently.\n\nHad a significant impact. The CEO characterized it as a record breaking customer acquisition from that marketing campaign.\n\nSo this kind of follows in the footsteps of Tesla ( TSLA ) and Cracker Barrel (CRBL). Those were different circumstances where we saw utilization of those stocks drag them down, and now you see a stock in the political spotlight that has sort of taken advantage of that notoriety to increase its sales.\n\nSo I think this might be a trend to keep an eye on as companies that rotate in and out of the political spotlight might be something investors should keep an eye on for more dramatic moves.\n\nRS: And marketing teams everywhere trying to bottle the sauce that American Eagle just unleashed. I bet a lot of high fives being handed all around.\n\nBS: I hope Sydney Sweeney got stock options for for her part of that deal.\n\nRS: Yeah. I hope Sydney Sweeney got stock options also. She seems a savvy businesswoman, so maybe she did.\n\nGoogle ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ), that hit the wires this week. Chrome, etcetera, what what are you seeing out of Google? And does that portend anything for the tech space?\n\nBS: Yeah. I think so. Google rose about 9% after news came down that they would not have to sell their Chrome browser as part of an antitrust case.\n\nThere were a few restrictions put on the company, but fundamentally, it was a slap on the wrists.\n\nI think that, again, looking at the political side of things, it suggests that we're in a low regulation mood in terms of the overall regulatory environment, which gives big tech kind of a a green light to move ahead.\n\nThere's always simmering tension about whether or not companies like Google or Apple ( AAPL ) or Microsoft ( MSFT ) should be broken up, or at least restrained.\n\nSo I think this is just a the sign that the current environment, they don't really have anything to worry about on that front.\n\nRS: Anything else before we leave our audience for another week?\n\nBS: Just in terms of earnings, there's an interesting debate going on about AI and the way AI is impacting the bottom line.\n\nSo you had Salesforce ( CRM ) report its earnings. It was down 7%. This contributed to a longer term downtrend. The stock is now down 28% year to date.\n\nIt beat expectations, but its guidance was not as strong as people had hoped. It had some progress on its AI related products, but it was not falling to the bottom line as quickly as investors had hoped.\n\nSo the question coming out of that earnings report is really, is this a single company execution problem or is this a sign that the AI impact that we're all hoping for is not going to be as dramatic as expected?\n\nAnd you can compare that to Alibaba ( BABA ), which was up sharply after its earnings. It had relatively modest overall revenue growth, I think around 2%, but had 26% growth in its cloud business pushed by its AI rollout.\n\nSo that's a company that's very quickly turning its AI adoption into real money, whereas Salesforce seems to be having a little trouble kind of connecting the two. So I think that's going to be a debate that comes up as we get information from these companies.\n\nAnd so that shines a spotlight on Adobe ( ADBE ), which is reporting next week. I think that'll be the next company that has that same sort of internal tension going on.\n\nI think it'll be something to look for in that earnings report and the conference call afterwards is how dramatically its AI investments are turning into revenue.\n\nRS: We have Broadcom ( AVGO ) reporting after the close today. Anything about that that you would add into this conversation?\n\nBS: Yeah. It's a good example. That's another one. You know, listeners are gonna have more information than we have right now about that, but that's another good data point in terms of the build out of the AI infrastructure.\n\nI think it's interesting to put that in comparison to companies like Salesforce and Adobe because they're on the other end of it. Those are the companies that are using products from NVIDIA ( NVDA ) or Broadcom to build out their AI capabilities.\n\nAnd so the question becomes, are the gold miners eventually gonna get the gold after buying the shovels and the picks from the shovel and pick salesman.\n\nLike I said, that'll be something to keep an eye on as we move forward.\n\nRS: And if I may set myself up for the assist, for those interested - I didn't do it deliberately. But for those interested in, Broadcom results and the tech space and some marinating post-results, we're gonna have Sara Awad from Tech Contrarians, Tech Stock Pros, back on Investing Experts midweek next week.\n\nSo look for that episode for all you tech observers and investors. Brian, appreciate you as always. Talk to you next week.\n\nBS: Talk to you next week.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

While the acquisition of Locked Solana appeals, we recognize there are many opportunities that we continue to explore,\" said Robert Lim, chief executive officer.\n\nThe company plans to establish a SOL-based treasury program using the native token of the Solana network to diversify its balance sheet and support growth initiatives. iSpecimen intends to source treasury management expertise for policy design, counterparty diligence, execution, custody coordination, risk management and reporting.\n\nThe treasury program contemplates purchasing SOL through over-the-counter transactions with cryptocurrency institutions, including Locked SOL that carries contractual transfer or vesting restrictions. Locked SOL typically trades at a discount to spot prices due to illiquidity and lock-up risk.\n\niSpecimen plans to fund the treasury program primarily from capital raised periodically. The company said it will employ a buy-and-hold strategy and purchase locked SOL at discounts. Plans include staking the Solana holdings to generate yields while maintaining a small percentage for spot trading.\n\niSpecimen operates an online marketplace connecting scientists with healthcare providers for human biospecimens used in medical research.",
