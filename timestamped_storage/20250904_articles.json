You've been with the company for a while, with Irish Life for a while. Maybe just talk a little bit about some of your near-term priorities, just to remind investors what you're focused on for Great-West?\n\nDavid Harney President, CEO & Director\n\nYes. So maybe just a brief introduction. Many people in the room won't know me. So yes, I'm in the role now since 1st of July. I became part of the Great-West Group in 2013 when Great-West bought Irish Life. That was during the global financial crisis. It was a great acquisition for Great-West, but a fantastic acquisition for Irish Life as well, and they've prospered within the group since that acquisition. I ran Irish Life from 2016 to 2020, ran the European business then for the last 5 years and more recently oversaw the Reinsurance business and I'm in this role now since 1st of July.\n\nSo I feel very lucky like I'm inheriting and coming into a portfolio that's in fantastic shape. We talk about our geographies, our markets and then our positions. So we believe we're in the right geographies at the",

So last week, you -- last Tuesday, you announced agreement to acquire EchoStar spectrum, both the 600 and then the mid-band spectrum. You did a call after the announcement. But maybe go back and just give us a little bit of the history to the lead up to the agreement to acquire that spectrum. And then from your seat in the CFO office, the framework that you put around the acquisition and the approach to valuation.\n\nPascal Desroches Senior EVP & CFO\n\nSure thing. Look, if you would ask me at the start of the year, would we have been making a significant spectrum purchase?
