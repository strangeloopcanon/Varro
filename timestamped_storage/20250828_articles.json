My name is Alexander Saverys, and I'm joined by my colleagues, Ludovic, Joris and Enya. We'd like to discuss the Cmb.Tech and Golden Ocean merger first to start. That is the news of last week. Then we will zoom in on the second quarter financials and highlights, concludes and have time for some questions and answers.\n\nLet me first start with the news of last week on the 20th of August, we have completed the Cmb.Tech and Golden Ocean merger to create a leading diversified maritime group. For those of you who have followed us before, you will recognize this slide, but I do want to take you through the combined Golden Ocean - Cmb.Tech fleet. We have today in 206 Modern Eco vessels on the water with another 44 on order. Of our 250 ships, about 1/3 will be powered or will be capable to be powered by ammonia and hydrogen. Our contract backlog stands at close to $3 billion, and the average age of our fleet is a tick under 6 years.\n\nThe total fair market value of the fleet is close to $11 billion, we have $1.9 billion of CapEx commitments still outstanding. We are listed on NYC in New York, Euronext Brussels and since last week as well on the Oslo Bors. You can see the detailed breakdown of our fleet at the bottom of the slide",

Edixhoven\n\nManagement by 10% on average a year. Clearly, market performance in the first half of this year was negative for us at EUR 3.3 billion. I'm proud the organic growth remained very strong with net inflows of EUR 4.6 billion, enabling us to pass the mark of EUR 150 billion assets under management for the first time. To cater to our growing client base, we invest in our staff, as I just mentioned, but also in our branch network.\n\nThe third component in our growth is inorganic growth. We successfully completed against planned integration of EVi and Robeco's online investment platform, enabling us to focus on attracting new clients in light of the pension reform in the Netherlands. Delivering on our M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions, we recently announced that Wilton Family Office will join us, strengthening our position in the highest segment of private banking as well as our presence in the south of the Netherlands.\n\nIf we move to the next slide. If we then return to the results in our client segments, it's clear that growth momentum remains strong. In the Netherlands, we recorded a net asset under management inflow of EUR 1.7 billion, of which about 50% is from new clients. Pretax profit was down to EUR 57.5 million due to lower interest income.\n\nPrivate Clients Belgium continued its strong performance with EUR 1 billion in net inflows",

All non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their GAAP counterparts in the attachments to this morning's press release and in schedules available on the company's website in the Quarterly Results section.

      "text": "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has sued President Donald Trump over his attempt to fire her, setting up a potential legal battle with implications for the US central bank's autonomy.\n\nCook has asked the court to declare Trump's firing order \"unlawful and void\", and also named Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as defendant.\n\nTrump has said there was \"sufficient reason\" to believe Cook had made false statements on her mortgage, and cited constitutional powers which he said allowed him to remove her. Cook previously said that \"no cause exists under the law\" to sack her.\n\nThe president has put increasing pressure on the Fed over what he sees as an \"unwillingness to lower interest rates.\n\nCook is part of the board responsible for setting interest rates in the US.\n\nThursday's lawsuit is likely to bring up a number of legal challenges that could end up at the US Supreme Court.\n\n\"This case challenges President Trump's unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would be the first of its kind in the Board's history,\" Abbe Lowell, Cook's attorney, wrote in the lawsuit.\n\n\"It would subvert the Federal Reserve Act ... which explicitly requires a showing of 'cause' for a Governor's removal, which an unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not,\" Lowell wrote.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai told the BBC the president \"exercised his lawful authority to remove\" Cook.\n\n\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" he said. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act does not give the president authority to remove a Fed official at will, but as Trump has said, it does allow him to do so \"for cause\".\n\nThe allegations against Cook were first made in a public letter from housing finance regulator, Bill Pulte, a Trump ally. In the letter he accused Cook of falsifying records to obtain a mortgage.\n\nThe letter alleges that she signed two documents, two weeks apart, attesting that two homes in different states were both her primary residence. No charges have been brought against Cook and it is unclear if she is under investigation for these allegations.\n\nCook's lawsuit does not address those allegations.\n\nShe previously denied that there was any cause to sack her and legal experts have shown scepticism in Trump's standing.\n\nShe is one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors, and in this position sits on the 12-member committee which is responsible for setting interest rates in the US.\n\nSince returning to Washington, Trump has put increasing pressure on the Fed - especially Powell - over interest rates.\n\nThe US president nominates candidates for the role, so removing Cook would mean she could be replaced by someone more favourable to lower interest rates and to the Trump economic agenda.\n\nThe Fed's decision affects the rate at which Americans can borrow money as well as the savings rates on their bank accounts. US interest rates are also closely watched by central banks who set monetary policy in other countries.\n\nCook voted alongside Powell and most other members of the committee to maintain US interest rates at the Fed's last rate-setting meeting at the end of July.",

The firm cautioned that the ETH/BTC uptrend \u201cis poised to be tested in the sessions ahead\u201d and warned that \u201conce the upside momentum faded from ETH/BTC rally, it would have been prudent for equity investors to put their guard up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBottom line, in prior cases over the last 10 or so years, every time we have seen such a robust and pronounced rise in the ETH/BTC crypto-pair, stocks have been sprinting higher in lockstep. However, once the upside momentum faded from ETH/BTC rally, it would have been prudent for equity investors to put their guard up,\u201d Sevens said.",

      "text": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin ticked higher on Thursday after hitting a seven-week low earlier this week, as investors weighed growing expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut next month against uncertainty following President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to fire a Federal Reserve governor.\n\nAs of 09:48 ET (13:48 GMT), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency traded 1% higher at $112,940.0.\n\nIt fell to a seven-week low below $109,000 earlier this week, but has rebounded slightly in the last two sessions to drift away from those lows.\n\nStill, Bitcoin has fallen more than 10% from an August record peak above $124,000.\n\nTrump on Tuesday announced he had fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook, effective immediately, over allegations of mortgage fraud, accusing her of misrepresenting home-ownership status in 2021 loan documents.\n\nThe allegations, referred to the Justice Department by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, are disputed by Cook, who said her dismissal was unlawful.\n\nCook\u2019s lawyer announced plans to sue the administration, arguing that the dismissal lacked legal grounds and violated the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nMarkets\u2019 focus has shifted back to increasing bets for an interest rate cut next month, with traders pricing in roughly an 85% chance of a quarter-point reduction in September.\n\nInvestors also await the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index due on Friday. The measure is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation and will play a critical role in shaping expectations for policy easing.\n\nCanary Capital has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the $TRUMP meme coin, a digital asset associated with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe proposed ETF aims to provide investors with regulated exposure to the token, which debuted in January 2025 and gained popularity on social media platforms.\n\nThe filing notes that the ETF\u2019s approval is uncertain due to the absence of a futures market for the $TRUMP coin, a requirement for such products under current SEC guidelines.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest increased its position in Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine Immersion (NYSE:BMNR) on Wednesday, picking up an additional $15.6 million in stock as shares moved lower.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s daily trading disclosure, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) added 227,569 shares, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) acquired 70,991 shares. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) also purchased 40,553 shares.\n\nEarlier this week, BitMine, which manages a large Ethereum treasury, reported that the combined value of its crypto and cash holdings had risen to $8.82 billion. That figure includes 1.71 million ETH, valued at about $7.9 billion.\n\nAltcoins were slightly up on Thursday, tracking rangebound moves in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWorld no.2 crypto Ethereum fell nearly 1% to $4,590.13, after hitting a record high of $4,955 earlier this week.\n\nWorld no. 3 crypto XRP added 0.2% to $3.01.\n\nSolana jumped 5% and Cardano edged up 1.2%, while Polygon traded nearly flat.\n\nAmong meme tokens, Dogecoin gained 2.7%, while $TRUMP rose 1%.\n\n(Ayushman Ojha contributed to this report.)",
