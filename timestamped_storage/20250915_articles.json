      "summary": "President Donald Trump said companies should not be forced to report earnings on a quarterly basis and should switch to posting numbers on a six-month basis.",
      "text": "Getty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nListen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify\n\nThe president says ending quarterly reporting will save money . (0:15) Elon Musk buys $1B in Tesla stock . (1:27) Alphabet joins the $3 trillion club . (2:37)\n\nThis is an abridged transcript of the podcast:\n\nOur top story so far, President Donald Trump said companies should not be forced to report earnings on a quarterly basis and should switch to posting numbers on a six-month basis.\n\n\"This will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\" Trump said.\n\nThe current SEC rules require companies to report results on a quarterly basis. But in the UK and EU, regulators require companies to file earnings twice a year, but they can choose to post quarterly statements.\n\n\"Did you ever hear the statement that 'China has a 50- to 100-year view on the management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!\" Trump posted.\n\nMainland China-listed companies are required to report quarterly earnings, as well as semiannual and annual. Hong Kong-listed companies do not require quarterly reports, but they are required to post interim results.\n\nWhile I can name a ton of financial journalists who would welcome earnings season just twice a year, longtime editor Herb Greenberg made the case for the status quo.\n\n\"Reporting quarterly is a good thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issue is guidance, short OR long-term. THAT'S what creates the short-term volatility as the algo's and everybody else play to THAT, and companies kowtow to the 'meet or beat' game.\"\n\n\"So let me repeat: The issue isn't quarterly reporting, but forward guidance, which would only get more extreme on a 6-month basis. And while they're at it, if they really want to address short-termism, they oughta get rid of adjusted earnings, too,\" he added.\n\nAmong active stocks, Tesla ( TSLA ) hit an eight-month high after CEO Elon Musk snapped up 2,568,732 shares of the company's stock.\n\nThe shares were bought on September 12 in a price range of $371.38 to $396.54 per share. The total amount of the Tesla stock purchases was over $1 billion.\n\nWedbush is bullish on early iPhone 17 sales. Apple's (APPL) latest model became available for preorder this week and analysts said there is strong consumer interest for the new smartphone line, despite some concerns related to the iPhone Air.\n\nAnalyst Dan Ives says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe believe that iPhone 17 preorders will be up 5-10% vs. last year as we estimate that roughly 20% of the 1.5 billion users worldwide have not upgraded their phones over the past 4 years speaking to this massive upgrade opportunity on the horizon for Cupertino as (Tim) Cook & Co. looks to leverage the largest consumer installed base in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a framework for a deal to keep ByteDance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ( BDNCE ) TikTok operating in the U.S. has been reached. President Trump also teased a deal ahead of a Sept. 17 deadline that would force ByteDance to sell its American assets.\n\nTrump posted on that a deal was reached on a \"certain\" company that \"young people in our Country very much wanted to save.\"\n\nAnd in other news of note, Alphabet ( GOOG ) (NGOOGL) became the fourth U.S. company to hit a $3 trillion market cap on Monday amid continued positive news flow. It joins Apple, Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) in the club.\n\nInvestors have had renewed enthusiasm in Alphabet since the company received favorable rulings in an antitrust lawsuit earlier this month.\n\nGoogle's cloud chief, Thomas Kurian, also recently said that Google Cloud had recently surpassed $106 billion in remaining performance obligations, amid continued demand for its services.\n\nIn addition, Gemini, Google's generative AI chatbot, overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on the App Store over the weekend.\n\nAnd speaking of OpenAI, board chairman Bret Taylor recently echoed Sam Altman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sentiments about being in an AI bubble. But like Altman, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound too worried about it in a recent interview with The Verge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Taylor said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\"If you look at the internet bubble, a lot of people think about the flops, like Pets.com and Webvan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Taylor added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough the lens of the past 30 years, though, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now gotten most of the largest companies in the world, including Amazon and Google, two of the largest companies in the world.\"\n\nThis article was written by",

      "text": "In this article\n\nCoreWeave shares jumped as much as 8% on Monday after the provider of cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence workloads disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia .\n\nUnder the terms of the arrangement, Nvidia \"is obligated to purchase the residual unsold capacity\" through April 2032, CoreWeave said in a filing . The company said it plans to include a copy of the full agreement alongside its third-quarter financial results.\n\nCoreWeave already spends heavily on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), which it then rents out to clients. The company, which went public in March, is backed by Nvidia, owner of about 7% of CoreWeave's Class A shares as of June 30.\n\nMike Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, said in a March interview thhat he's \"not bashful\" about reaching out to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nIn its IPO prospectus, CoreWeave warned that it's dependent on a limited number of suppliers, and all of the GPUs in its infrastructure at the time had come from Nvidia. Cloud providers Amazon , Google , Microsoft and Oracle also rely on Nvidia for chips to help them meet AI demand. Google and Microsoft have both turned to CoreWeave for additional capacity.\n\nIn August, CoreWeave reported $1.21 billion in second-quarter revenue , up 207% year over year. The company has continued to lose money, recording a $290.5 million net loss in the period.\n\nWhile CoreWeave is largely reliant on Nvidia chips for its business, the company has other large customers when it comes to compute capacity. Earlier this year, CoreWeave secured a contract with OpenAI that's worth $11.9 billion over five years.\n\nWith Monday's rally, CoreWeave shares have tripled since their IPO, and the company is now valued at over $58 billion.\n\nWATCH: CoreWeave CEO: Companies building the AI can not get enough compute, this is a tailwind for us",

      "text": "President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.\n\nIn a Truth Social post , Trump said the idea is \"subject to SEC approval\" and would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!'\" Trump said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the issue but no recommendations came of the matter.\n\nThe wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.\n\n\"In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,\" the pair wrote.\n\nCurrent regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.\n\nLogistically, the move would not require support from Congress but rather just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat. The process likely would take six to 12 months, said Sarah Bianchi, chief strategist of international political affairs and public policy at Evercore ISI.\n\n\"Administrations have to varying degrees given policy steers to the SEC, and with Trump's directive this is now something that has to be taken seriously as a possibility,\" Bianchi, a former U.S. deputy trade representative, said in a note. \"However, the SEC has also historically been able to operate with some measure of independence.\"\n\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins has not spoken on the issue.\n\n\"If the effort at the SEC to reconsider quarterly reporting gains steam, it could also prompt conversations around when and how companies issue guidance and communicate with investors that would have important ramifications for public markets,\" Bianchi added.\n\nSupporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.\n\n\"When you weigh this out and put it on a whiteboard, the pros of quarterly reporting outweigh the cons,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \"Having to wait six months for official results, I just think would cause more difficulties than it would add benefits.\"\n\nWhile executives have come under some criticism for reporting misleading earnings, the use of generally accepted accounting principles \u2014 GAAP \u2014 has helped provide guardrails that ensure standardization. For that reason, U.S. reporting is considered among the most transparent and reliable in the world.\n\nDespite Trump's comments about China, companies there have reporting requirements that are similar to the U.S. if not more stringent. Chinese companies must file quarterly earnings reports as well as semiannual and annual reports.\n\nCompanies listed on the Hong Kong exchange, however, only report every six months.\n\nTrump's proposal would be more in line with practices in the U.K. and European Union, where companies are required to file semiannually but can issue quarterly reports if they choose.\n\nBut Hogan said the comparison between U.S. and European companies isn't valid.\n\n\"How many companies in the European markets have trillion-dollar market caps and are growing revenues at 60% a year or have gross margins that are north of 50%?\" he said. \"The investor is better suited to having more information than less or more frequent information.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Norway's sovereign wealth fund proposed switching to semiannual reporting, reasoning that lengthening the time frame would allow companies to focus on the longer term. The Long-Term Stock Exchange trading platform also has supported less frequent reporting.\n\nThe White House declined further comment on Trump's post. CNBC has reached out to the SEC for comment.\n\n( Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live. Tickets and info here . )",

I'm Lindsey Crabbe, and I'm pleased to serve as today's moderator. Joining me are Rich Byrne, CEO of FBRT; Mike Comparato, President of FBRT; and Jerry Baglien, CFO and COO of FBRT.\n\nBefore we get started, there's just a few housekeeping notes. We are going to record this webinar and post it to our website so anyone can join if they'd like to in the future. And please take a moment to review the forward-looking statement slide that should be on your screen here in a moment. Today, we're going to cover the key aspects of the Newpoint acquisition and our previously filed pro forma financial statements. [Operator Instructions].\n\nSo moving on, I'll ahead and get started. As many of you know, we closed our acquisition of Newpoint on July 1. To quickly recap, Newpoint is a leading vertically integrated commercial real estate finance company. Newpoint provides loan origination, servicing, asset management and a suite of agency products. And Newpoint is one of just 19 multifamily originators in the U.S. approved by all 3 GSEs: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA/HUD. This acquisition adds a scaled agency origination and servicing platform to FBRT, which enhances our income stability and creates a pathway for long-term book value per share growth.\n\nWith that, let's jump into our discussion.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nLindsey Crabbe Director of Investor Relations\n\nMike, would you be able to walk through what we are aiming to accomplish by bringing Newpoint onto our balance sheet and maybe go through how it",

      "text": "BBC director general Tim Davie has said the corporation is \"aware of the concerns\" around Israel taking part in next year's Eurovision, adding that the song contest has \"never been about politics\".\n\nSpeaking on Monday in front of parliament's public accounts committee, Davie said the BBC would \"work with\" Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), on the issue.\n\n\"Eurovision has never been about politics, it should be a celebration of music and culture that brings people together. We need to see what the broadcast union decides,\" he added.\n\nFellow broadcasters from Ireland , the Netherlands , Slovenia, Iceland and now Spain have all threatened to boycott the event if Israel is allowed to take part over the country's actions in Gaza.\n\n\"We're very aware of the concerns,\" the BBC boss told the committee. \"It's obviously a well-debated topic and difficult.\n\n\"At this stage we are supportive of the European Broadcast Union's work. They are going around discussing with members, working through all the processes by which they would be satisfied to make a decision one way or the other.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"really important... that we try to preserve\" the celebratory element of the contest.\n\n\"But at this stage, I'm supporting the European Broadcasting Union's work, and they need to get on with it.\"\n\nEarlier this year, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the 2025 competition in Basel, which Austrian singer JJ won after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute.\n\nAs a result, next summer's event will be held in the Austrian capital of Vienna.\n\nSpain's Culture Minister Ernest Urtasun has now said Israel should not take part in the next Eurovision, repeating calls made by the country's Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, earlier this year.\n\nIn 2024, Spain joined Norway and Ireland in acknowledging a Palestinian state and last week, S\u00e1nchez accused Israel of genocide and announced a series of measures against it, including an arms embargo.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar responded by accusing Sanchez's administration of being antisemitic and of using \"wild and hateful rhetoric\".\n\nIn August, the UN-backed food monitor, the IPC, confirmed that famine was taking place in parts of Gaza. Israel is accused of causing the famine through ongoing restrictions on food and medical aid entering the territory.\n\nIsrael controls all border crossings into the Gaza Strip, and as the occupying power bears responsibility for protecting civilian life under international law, which includes the prevention of starvation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.\n\nIsrael has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nRussia was banned from competing in Eurovision in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe EBU said at the time that Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\".\n\nBefore making this decision, the EBU said it had taken time to consult widely among its membership.\n\nUkraine went on to win the contest.\n\nEurovision is loved for its camp pop hits, soaring ballads and everything inbetween.\n\nBut over the years, artists have used their platform to send subtle - and not so subtle - political messages.\n\nIn 2023, Switzerland sent an anti-war song, Watergun, while Iceland were fined \u20ac5,000 back in 2019 for flying a Palestinian flag during the competition.\n\nIn 2016, Ukraine also won the event with a song called 1944 about the ethnic cleansing of Crimean Tatars in that year by Soviet forces.",

      "text": "Stellar\u2019s XLM token endured sharp swings over the past 24 hours, tumbling 3% as institutional selling pressure dominated order books. The asset declined from $0.39 to $0.38 between September 14 at 15:00 and September 15 at 14:00, with trading volumes peaking at 101.32 million\u2014nearly triple its 24-hour average. The heaviest liquidation struck during the morning hours of September 15, when XLM collapsed from $0.395 to $0.376 within two hours, establishing $0.395 as firm resistance while tentative support formed near $0.375.\n\nDespite the broader downtrend, intraday action highlighted moments of resilience. From 13:15 to 14:14 on September 15, XLM staged a brief recovery, jumping from $0.378 to a session high of $0.383 before closing the hour at $0.380. Trading volume surged above 10 million units during this window, with 3.45 million changing hands in a single minute as bulls attempted to push past resistance. While sellers capped momentum, the consolidation zone around $0.380\u2013$0.381 now represents a potential support base.\n\nMarket dynamics suggest distribution patterns consistent with institutional profit-taking. The persistent supply overhead has reinforced resistance at $0.395, where repeated rally attempts have failed, while the emergence of support near $0.375 reflects opportunistic buying during liquidation waves. For traders, the $0.375\u2013$0.395 band has become the key battleground that will define near-term direction.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

Here&#x27;s a recap of Monday&#x27;s key moments. 1. The S &amp; P 500 hit an all-time high Monday as the market welcomed President Donald Trump &#x27;s positive update that trade talks between the U.S. and China were going &quot;very well.&quot; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides reached a &quot;framework&quot; deal on TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. Elsewhere, investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday&#x27;s expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut. And, with tech up Monday, we took some profits to reduce our outsized Broadcom position weight in the portfolio. The stock has been on fire since earnings earlier this month. On Thursday, we let members know we were looking to trim when we weren&#x27;t restricted. 2. Nvidia shares were flat Monday after the U.S. chipmaker was accused by China of breaking antitrust laws. But this idea &quot;that maybe there&#x27;s some good movement in trading talks with China may be good, makes me even less worried about Nvidia,&quot; and news of the investigation, Jim Cramer said. According to China&#x27;s market regulators, Nvidia&#x27;s acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox in 2020 violated conditions of China&#x27;s anti-monopoly law. Jim believes the move by China is &quot;politically motivated.&quot; Last month, Nvidia cut a deal with the U.S. government to allow exports of some of its chips to China. &quot;I am hoping that this company is part of a comprehensive deal&quot; in trade negotiations with China, Jim said. 3. &quot;We need to buy a lot more Boeing, &quot; Jim said Monday. The Club started a position in the aircraft giant on Sept. 8 and added shares Friday. Boeing shares have fallen roughly 5.8% since our initiation, likely due to the latest reports that the company is behind on certifying its newest 777X jet. But for Jim, this is another shot to load up. &quot;I really want to pound the table on Boeing,&quot; Jim said, reiterating that members should &quot;own&quot; the stock. 4. Stocks covered in Monday&#x27;s rapid fire at the end of the video were: Tesla Inc ., VF Corp. , CoreWeave , Union Pacific , and Builders FirstSource . (Jim Cramer&#x27;s Charitable Trust is long AVGO, BA, NVDA. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

      "summary": "The East Wiltshire MP said the Conservatives were no longer the main party of opposition.",
      "text": "Conservative MP Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK.\n\nKruger has been an MP since 2019, and sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister.\n\n\"The Conservatives are over,\" he told a press conference, sitting alongside Reform party leader Nigel Farage.\n\nKruger said he had been \"honoured\" to be asked to help Reform prepare for government, and said he hoped that Farage would be the next prime minister.\n\nThe East Wiltshire MP - who has said he would not be triggering a by-election - said the Conservatives were no longer the main party of opposition.\n\nHe said: \"There have been moments when I have been very proud to belong to the Tory party\", but added: \"The rule of our time in office was failure.\n\n\"Bigger government, social decline, lower wages, higher taxes and less of what ordinary people actually wanted.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is my tragic conclusion, the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the left.\"\n\nAlthough he said he had \"great regard\" for Badenoch, he said the Tory party had a \"toxic brand\", adding: \"We have had a year of stasis and drift and the sham unity that comes from not doing anything bold or difficult or controversial.\"\n\nDescribing his move leaving a party he has been a member of for 20 years as \"personally painful\", he said his \"mission\" with Reform would be to \"not just to overthrow the current system, it is to restore the system we need\".\n\nResponding to the news of the defection, Badenoch said: \"Danny has made his case very clear, that this is not about me.\n\n\"I can't be distracted by that, and I'm not going to get blown off course by these sort of incidents.\n\n\"I know this is the sort of thing that is going to happen while a party is changing. I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"\n\nKruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.\n\nSpeaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.\n\nA few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, telling MPs in July : \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"\n\nAsked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.\n\n\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"\n\nKruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.\n\nReform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.\n\nIn 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nHowever, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.\n\nHis political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.\n\nA keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".\n\nIn 2023, Kruger was one of the speakers at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".\n\nKruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.\n\nA Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes \u2013 it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.\n\n\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".\n\n\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.\n\nGreen Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

      "summary": "The DOJE fund could launch this week, signaling a new phase in crypto's merger with traditional finance, even if \u2018utility\u2019 isn\u2019t part of the equation.",
      "text": "The first exchange-traded fund (ETF) built around a meme coin could hit the market this week, after multiple delays and much speculation.\n\nThe DOGE ETF \u2014 formally called the Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) \u2014 was originally slated to debut last week, alongside a handful of politically themed and crypto-related ETFs. Those included funds tied to Bonk BONK $ 0.0\u20842295 , XRP, Bitcoin BTC $ 108,783.53 and even a Trump-themed fund. But DOJE\u2019s debut never materialized.\n\nNow, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe Wednesday is the most likely launch date, though they caution nothing is certain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely than not,\u201d Seyffart said. \u201cThat seems like the base case.\u201d\n\nAhead of the introduction of the ETF, DOGE has been among the top performers over the past month, ahead 15% even including a decline of 3.5% over the past 24 horus.\n\nIf launched, DOJE would mark a milestone as the first U.S. ETF to focus on a meme coin \u2014 cryptocurrencies that generally lack utility or a clear economic purpose. These include tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu SHIB $ 0.0\u20841300 and Bonk, which often surge in popularity thanks to internet culture, celebrity endorsements and speculative trading.\n\nBalchunas described DOJE\u2019s significance in a post on X: \u201cFirst-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.\u201d\n\nDOJE is not a spot ETF. That means it won\u2019t hold DOGE directly. Instead, the fund will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. This approach sidesteps the need for physical custody of the coin while still offering traders a way to bet on its performance within a traditional brokerage account.\n\nThe ETF was approved earlier this month under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is typically used for mutual funds and diversified ETFs. That sets it apart from the wave of bitcoin ETFs that received green lights under the Securities Act of 1933, a framework used for commodity-based and asset-backed products. In short, DOJE is structured more like a mutual fund than a commodity trust.\n\nMore direct exposure may be coming soon. Several firms have filed applications to launch spot DOGE ETFs, which would hold the meme coin itself rather than derivatives. These applications are still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , which has grown more comfortable with crypto ETFs since approving a slate of bitcoin products in early 2024.\n\nThe broader crypto market has shown that investor demand can outweigh fundamental critiques. Meme coins have long drawn skepticism for having no underlying value or use case, but that hasn't kept them from drawing billions in speculative capital.\n\nSeyffart said the ETF market is likely to follow the same path. \u201cThere's going to be a bunch of products like this, whether you love it or need it, they're going to be coming to market,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that many existing financial products serve no deeper purpose than providing a vehicle for short-term bets. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of products out there that are just being used as gambling or short-term trading,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if there's an audience for this in the crypto world, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this finds an audience in the ETF and TradFi world.\u201d\n\nWhether the DOJE ETF opens the door to more meme coin funds \u2014 or just proves the concept is viable \u2014 may depend on how the market responds this week. Either way, it signals a new phase in the merging of internet culture and traditional finance.\n\nMore For You\n\nXLM Sees Heavy Volatility as Institutional Selling Weighs on Price\n\nStellar\u2019s XLM token slid 3% amid institutional selling, but intraday volatility showed signs of short-lived recovery.\n\nWhat to know :",

      "text": "Hedera Hashgraph\u2019s HBAR token endured steep losses over a volatile 24-hour window between September 14 and 15, falling 5% from $0.24 to $0.23. The token\u2019s trading range expanded by $0.01 \u2014 a move often linked to outsized institutional activity \u2014 as heavy corporate selling overwhelmed support levels. The sharpest move came between 07:00 and 08:00 UTC on September 15, when concentrated liquidation drove prices lower after days of resistance around $0.24.\n\nInstitutional trading volumes surged during the session, with more than 126 million tokens changing hands on the morning of September 15 \u2014 nearly three times the norm for corporate flows. Market participants attributed the spike to portfolio rebalancing by large stakeholders, with enterprise adoption jitters and mounting regulatory scrutiny providing the backdrop for the selloff.\n\nRecovery efforts briefly emerged during the final hour of trading, when corporate buyers tested the $0.24 level before retreating. Between 13:32 and 13:35 UTC, one accumulation push saw 2.47 million tokens deployed in an effort to establish a price floor. Still, buying momentum ultimately faltered, with HBAR settling back into support at $0.23.\n\nThe turbulence underscores the token\u2019s vulnerability to institutional distribution events. Analysts point to the failed breakout above $0.24 as confirmation of fresh resistance, with $0.23 now serving as the critical support zone. The surge in volume suggests major corporate participants are repositioning ahead of regulatory shifts, leaving HBAR\u2019s near-term outlook dependent on whether enterprise buyers can mount sustained defenses above key support.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

      "text": "Gold (XAU/USD) kicks off the week on a positive footing, breaking out of last week\u2019s sideways momentum after peaking at an all-time high near $3,675 on Tuesday. The move reflects renewed buying interest as traders position cautiously ahead of a pivotal week packed with central bank monetary policy decisions.\n\nAt the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading around $3,660, up nearly 0.45% on the day, inching closer to its record high and recovering strongly from intraday lows near $3,626.\n\nThe spotlight is firmly on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate decision due on Wednesday. Markets are fully pricing a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut, with a small possibility of a surprise jumbo 50 bps move. Alongside the Fed , monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England (BoE), Bank of Japan (BoJ), and Bank of Canada (BoC) add to the event-heavy backdrop, potentially amplifying market volatility across asset classes, including Gold.\n\nOverall, broader sentiment continues to lend strong support to the precious metal. Subdued US Treasury yields, a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD), and lingering geopolitical risks all reinforce safe-haven demand, leaving Gold well-positioned near record highs with scope to extend its upward trajectory.\n\nXAU/USD is pushing higher on the 4-hour chart, holding above the $3,650 psychological mark after repeated tests last week. The move follows the all-time high near $3,675, with momentum indicators showing an upward bias.\n\nThe 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) is flat around $3,641 and acting as immediate support within the range, helping to cushion intraday dips. Below that, the $3,626-$3,630 zone marks the lower boundary of the consolidation, while the 50-SMA near $3,613 provides an additional layer of protection should selling pressure deepen.\n\nOn the upside, XAU/USD has cleared the $3,650 ceiling, strengthening the case for a retest of the all-time high at $3,675. A sustained 4-hour close above this level would likely pave the way for an extension toward the $3,700 psychological barrier if follow-through buying persists.\n\nMomentum indicators support the bullish bias. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed toward 66, reflecting growing upward momentum without overbought conditions, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) at 31 suggests trend strength is moderate.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) deliberates on monetary policy and makes a decision on interest rates at eight pre-scheduled meetings per year. It has two mandates: to keep inflation at 2%, and to maintain full employment. Its main tool for achieving this is by setting interest rates \u2013 both at which it lends to banks and banks lend to each other. If it decides to hike rates, the US Dollar (USD) tends to strengthen as it attracts more foreign capital inflows. If it cuts rates, it tends to weaken the USD as capital drains out to countries offering higher returns. If rates are left unchanged, attention turns to the tone of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, and whether it is hawkish (expectant of higher future interest rates), or dovish (expectant of lower future rates).\n\nNext release: Wed Sep 17, 2025 18:00\n\nFrequency: Irregular\n\nConsensus: 4.25%\n\nPrevious: 4.5%\n\nSource: Federal Reserve\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "summary": "With a fall rate cut looking likely now, households may finally get some relief from the sky-high borrowing costs\u00a0\u2014 depending on a few key financial moves.",
      "text": "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark rate when it meets this week, despite the latest hotter-than-expected inflation data .\n\nThe market is now pricing in a 96% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut this month, according to the CME Fedwatch tool .\n\n\"The betting is currently that the Fed will embark on rate cutting, concerned about burgeoning downside risks in the economy, and the job market, in particular,\" Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said in an email.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: More consumers use rent payments to boost their credit score Some jobs may not qualify for the 'no tax on tips' policy Trump administration to warn families about student debt risks\n\nFor Americans\u00a0struggling\u00a0to keep up with\u00a0sky-high interest charges, a likely\u00a0September rate cut could bring some welcome relief.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which is set by the U.S. central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the rates they see every day.\n\nFrom\u00a0credit cards to car payments and the interest on your savings account, here's a breakdown of what to expect when the Fed starts trimming its benchmark \u2014 and what you can do now to be in a better position to benefit.\n\n\"Rate cuts are welcome news for Americans with debt, but one small reduction won't make much difference when bills come due,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit\u00a0analyst.\n\nWith a rate cut, the prime rate lowers, too, and the interest rates on variable-rate debt \u2014 most notably credit cards \u2014 are likely to follow. But even then, APRs will only ease off extremely high levels.\n\n\"Borrowers should get some relief in the coming months, although it's worth pointing out that interest rates are still elevated,\" said Ted Rossman,\u00a0Bankrate's senior industry analyst. \"Especially credit cards, which carry an\u00a0average rate\u00a0of 20.13%.\"\n\nThat means that if the central bank cuts rates by a quarter point,\u00a0it won't have a significant impact on your credit card rate. \"Existing borrowers could see their rates go down by half a point or so,\" Rossman said.\n\nRather than wait for a small adjustment in the months ahead, borrowers could switch now to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a personal loan , experts often say.\n\n\"For people who have high-interest debt \u2014 credit cards or double-digit interest on car loans \u2014 that is the priority, you want to target that as much as possible,\" said Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nAlthough auto loan rates are fixed for the life of the loan, ballooning payments have become another pain point for consumers. Experts say many car shoppers could benefit from paying down revolving debt and improving their credit scores , which could pave the way to even better loan terms in the future.\n\nSince rates on online savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit are also poised to go down with a Fed rate cut, experts say this is the time to secure\u00a0some of the best returns available.\n\n\"Many high-yield savings accounts and CDs currently offer rates over 4% \u2014 more than 10 times the national average,\" said Swati Bhatia,\u00a0head of retail banking at Santander Bank.\n\nEven once the Fed lowers interest rates, savers can still benefit from those competitive rates, especially with a CD, which allows them to lock in a higher interest rate for a set term, she said.\n\nA typical saver with about\u00a0$8,000\u00a0in a checking or savings account\u00a0could earn an additional\u00a0$320\u00a0a year by moving that money into a CD or high-yield account that earns an interest rate of 4% or more,\u00a0according to a recent survey by Santander Bank.\n\nStill, many Americans keep their savings in traditional accounts, Santander found, which\u00a0FDIC data shows are currently paying 0.39% , on average.\n\n\"The housing market would be the biggest beneficiary of lower rates as they would unlock frozen sales by homeowners who are reluctant to give up the low-rate mortgages taken out in the decade following the Great Recession,\" Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email.\n\nAlthough mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the economy , they've already come down significantly from their peak at over 7% back in January.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now just under 6.3% as of Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily .\n\n\"Over the last several weeks, the consumer sentiment around mortgages has become a little healthier, we are starting to see some nice momentum,\" said John Hummel, head of retail\u00a0home\u00a0lending at U.S. Bank.\n\nAs more potential home buyers enter the market, that frees up more inventory, Hummel added. And, \"if we see some additional rate cuts, that bodes well as we get into the later half of the year.\"\n\nUltimately, across virtually all consumer products, those with better credit will qualify for the best loan terms at the lowest interest rate.\n\nBoosting your credit score largely comes down to paying your bills on time every month, keeping balances low and only applying for credit as needed, according to Tommy Lee, senior director of scores and predictive analytics at FICO.\n\nAs a general rule, keep revolving debt below 30% of available credit and \"don't go out and open 10 credit cards,\" Lee said.\n\nYou may also be able to improve your credit score by regularly checking your credit report and addressing any errors, added Schulz. \"Even a single late payment on your credit report can knock 50 points or more off of your credit score, so if there's one listed wrongly on your report, you need to get it fixed.\"\n\nThat can be the difference between a \"good\" score, which is generally is above 670, and a \"very good\" score over 740, which could qualify you for the most favorable terms . (FICO scores, the most popular scoring model, range from 300 to 850.)\n\n\"It is important for people to understand that they can have a far bigger impact on their interest rates than the Fed ever will,\" Schulz said.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

Without changes, they argued, firms may shop around for lenient jurisdictions, undermining both investor protection and Europe\u2019s competitiveness in digital assets.\n\nThe regulators set out four proposals. Chief among them is handing direct supervision of the largest crypto-asset service providers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) . They also want to close loopholes allowing EU intermediaries to route orders to offshore platforms not bound by MiCA, a practice that leaves investors without regulatory safeguards.\n\nThe authorities also called for mandatory, independent cybersecurity audits before firms receive or renew MiCA licenses, citing the sector\u2019s high exposure to hacks. Finally, they proposed a centralized filing system for token white papers to simplify cross-border offerings and ensure legal clarity.\n\nWhile MiCA was designed to harmonize crypto oversight across the EU, the three regulators say swift adjustments are needed to align with international standards set by the Financial Stability Board and IOSCO.

      "text": "The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is moving cautiously at the start of the week against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/CAD Forex pair hovering around 1.3835, down very slightly over the session.\n\nMarket operators are holding their breath ahead of the release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday at 12:30 GMT, a figure that could seal the trajectory of the Bank of Canada's (BoC) monetary policy.\n\nTherefore, the CAD\u2019s performance today is therefore marked by measured volatility, with traders preferring to wait for the data before taking positions. On Tuesday, the CPI release comes in at the same time as US Retail Sales , which could make USD/CAD one of the most volatile pairs in the Forex market .\n\nWith headline inflation expected to rise to 2.0% year-on-year (from 1.7% previously) and a more modest monthly increase (+0.1%), the market is looking to determine whether the Bank of Canada will still have room to ease policy in the months ahead.\n\nCanada's CPI is a crucial indicator, especially as core inflation, which excludes the most volatile components such as energy and perishables, remains the BoC's preferred thermometer.\n\nIn July, core measures showed signs of losing steam, but the trend remains uncertain. Derek Holt of Scotiabank already noted last month that \"the underlying inflation trend does not call for massive rate cuts, but recent data remain fragile and subject to revision\".\n\nInflation remains strongly influenced by the prolonged fall in energy prices, particularly gasoline, alleviated by the abolition of the federal carbon tax in April.\n\nThis factor has artificially contained the overall index, masking more robust dynamics in food, housing and services prices.\n\nAccording to an RBC note, \"the August CPI could be the real arbiter between the status quo and further monetary easing. The BoC is keeping a close eye on the median and trim measures, which remain around 3%, the upper limit of its target\".\n\nRecent figures also confirm the resilience of consumption. Household spending rose sharply in the second quarter, despite a decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the housing market is showing signs of recovery. Too rapid an easing in interest rates could therefore fuel renewed inflationary pressures.\n\nThe release of the August CPI could prove decisive. A higher-than-expected figure would reinforce the position of the BoC's more cautious members, and mechanically support the Canadian dollar by postponing the prospect of further rate cuts. Conversely, confirmation of a lasting slowdown in inflation would breathe new life into the bond markets, while weighing on the CAD.\n\nRate swaps are currently anticipating a high probability of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut to 2.5% this week, only one day after the CPI release. But investors know that the BoC's approach remains highly data-dependent.\n\nAs Derek Holt sums up: \"The BoC won't be able to rely on such volatile readings to adjust its policy. It will wait for more tangible evidence before deciding.\"\n\nFor the time being, the foreign exchange market is on a wait-and-see basis. For the CAD, the release of the CPI is much more than just a statistic; it is the next test of monetary credibility and the key to a trajectory that could redefine the CAD's outlook between now and the end of the year.\n\nUSD/CAD 4-hour chart. Source: FXStreet\n\nAfter last weekend's sharp downward correction, the USD/CAD pair found support around 1.3820 on Monday and is attempting to rebound. But the movement remains timid, and a wait-and-see attitude is prevailing.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, USD/CAD is evolving within a triangle of uncertainty, with a trendless 100-period moving average reinforcing the wait-and-see sentiment.\n\nAn exit from this triangle, whose limits currently lie at 1.3790 and 1.3885, will be decisive for the pair's next short-term trend. This week's CPI release and BoC meeting will most likely play an important role in shaping this trend.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today.

      "summary": "The Zapad-2025 military drills come just days after Poland accused Moscow of violating its air space with a drone incursion.",
      "text": "In a large field 45 miles (72km) from Belarus' capital Minsk, a battle is raging.\n\nThere are giant explosions as Sukhoi-34 bombers drop guided bombs. Huge plumes of smoke darken the sky.\n\nThe whole area echoes to the sound of exploding mortar and artillery shells. Helicopter gunships join the attack, while surveillance drones sweep overhead to view the damage.\n\nIt's only an exercise, though.\n\nTogether with other international media we've been brought to the Borisovsky training ground where Belarusian and Russian forces are taking part in joint manoeuvres.\n\nIt's part of the Zapad-2025 (\"West 2025\") military drills. Military attach\u00e9s, too, from a variety of embassies are observing the drill from a viewing platform.\n\nThese are planned exercises - \"West 2025\" takes place every four years.\n\nIn 2022 200,000 troops took part, while this year's exercises involved fewer soldiers.\n\nMoscow and Minsk maintain that the drills are of a purely defensive nature, that they're designed to strengthen the security of Russia and Belarus and to counter any potential external threat.\n\nI remember hearing similar claims three and a half years ago.\n\nIn February 2022 I visited Belarus to report on the Belarusian-Russian military exercise \"Union Resolve\". When the exercise was over, instead of returning home Russian troops invaded neighbouring Ukraine from the territory of Belarus.\n\nThis time Belarus insists it has nothing to hide.\n\nRepresentatives of 23 states, including the US, Turkey and Hungary, watched the military exercise.\n\n\"We consider that the exercise is unprecedented in its transparency,\" Major General Valery Revenko, assistant to the Belarusian defence minister, told journalists at the training ground.\n\n\"We are not threatening anyone. We are for constructive and pragmatic dialogue.\"\n\nClearly Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk isn't convinced. He had dubbed the \"West 2025\" drills \"very aggressive\". Poland shut its border with Belarus ahead of the exercises, prompting an angry response from Minsk.\n\n\"West 2025\" coincides with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European region. To the south, Russia shows no sign of ending its war on Ukraine.\n\nLast week Poland accused Russia of intentionally violating its air space with a Russian drone incursion. Nato scrambled fighter jets to shoot down some of the drones.\n\nMoscow responded by claiming that it \"hadn't planned to engage targets on Polish territory.\"\n\nYesterday Romania revealed that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, too. In Europe there is widespread concern that such drone incursions are no accident , but a Russian strategy to test the unity and resolve of European leaders and of the Nato alliance.\n\nBoth Russia and Belarus have made efforts recently to improve ties with Washington and to construct a relationship with the Trump administration. But in the case of both Moscow and Minsk relations with Europe remain strained.\n\nThe decision by the Belarusian authorities to invite international media to the \"West 2025\" exercise can be seen two ways.\n\nFirst, as an attempt at transparency - that's certainly how Minsk is portraying it.\n\nBut in the explosions and the gunfire on the Borisovsky training ground there is, perhaps too, a message for the West. And first and foremost, for Europe.\n\nThat message may read something like this: \"See and consider the firepower on your doorstep; confrontation with Moscow is not in your best interest.\"",

The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in early November, after the Trump administration appealed lower court rulings that found the president had exceeded his authority.\n\nSwagel said that the outcome of the Supreme Court tariff case is \"one of the key uncertainties in the economy.\"\n\nBut that uncertainty is likely to fade over time, according to the CBO's latest report.\n\n\"The effects of policy uncertainty dissipate over time and disappear by the end of 2027, returning investment to what it would have been without the uncertainty in trade\u00a0policy,\" the September CBO analysis said.",

      "text": "EUR/CHF kicks off the week on a positive note, attracting fresh buying interest after briefly falling to its lowest level since August 1 late last week. At the time of writing, the cross trades around 0.9350 on Monday, as the Euro draws some support from hawkish European Central Bank (ECB) commentary while fresh Swiss data highlight deepening disinflation.\n\nECB board member Isabel Schnabel struck a firm tone on Monday, underscoring that interest rates are in a \u201cgood place\u201d and warning that upside risks to inflation dominate. She added that the pass-through from a stronger euro is likely to be limited, while highlighting that economic growth in the euro area is expected to exceed potential.\n\nThese remarks come in the wake of the ECB\u2019s September monetary policy decision, where the Governing Council left all three key interest rates unchanged, keeping the deposit rate at 2.00%. Policymakers stressed that the current stance is appropriate and reiterated a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach. The combination of stable rates and Schnabel\u2019s hawkish lean reinforces the view that the easing phase of monetary policy is widely considered to be nearing its end, lending near-term support to the Euro.\n\nOn the Swiss side, the latest figures confirmed a persistent disinflationary trend. The Producer and Import Price Index fell 0.6% MoM in August, sharply missing expectations for a 0.1% rise and following a -0.2% decline in July. On an annual basis, prices dropped -1.8%, a steeper fall than July\u2019s -0.9%. The weak data highlight that cost pressures in Switzerland are fading, keeping headline inflation well below the SNB\u2019s 0-2% target band.\n\nDespite subdued inflation, SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel recently stressed that the bar for reintroducing negative interest rates is high. In an interview earlier this month, he warned of the unwanted side effects of subzero rates, particularly for savers and pension funds, suggesting the central bank will be reluctant to cut below zero again.\n\nLooking ahead, traders will keep a close eye on speeches from ECB President Christine Lagarde and Executive Board member Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, both due later on Monday.\n\nThe European Central Bank's President Christine Lagarde, born in 1956 in France, has formerly served as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, and minister of finance in France. She began her eight-year term at the helm of the ECB in November 2019. As part of her job in the Governing Council, Lagarde holds press conferences in detailing how the ECB observes the current and future state of the European economy. Her comments may positively or negatively the Euro's trend in the short term. Usually, a hawkish outlook boosts the Euro (bullish), while a dovish one weighs on the common currency (bearish).\n\nNext release: Mon Sep 15, 2025 18:10\n\nFrequency: Irregular\n\nConsensus: -\n\nPrevious: -\n\nSource: European Central Bank\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Ahead of Wednesday's critical Fed policy announcements, the US Dollar (USD) struggles to find demand and helps the pair hold its ground.\n\nGBP/USD retreats slightly but remains in positive territory after setting a fresh two-month high above 1.3600 earlier in the day. Traders might be looking to adjust their positions ahead of this week's critical Fed and BoE policy meetings, limiting the pair's volatility.\n\nGold gathers bullish momentum and trades comfortably above $3,650 after falling toward $3,620 in the European session. Growing expectations for a dovish tilt in the Fed's policy outlook weigh\u00a0on US T-bond yields and allow XAU/USD to stretch higher.\n\nInflation is not too hot, but the job market is more worrying \u2013 that is the growing narrative about the US economy. Now, the Federal Reserve\u00a0is set to cut rates, in a decision with many moving parts. And there's more in store.\n\nInflation picked up speed in August across major economies, though still very moderately. Inflation expectations continue to diverge between the US and the rest of the world. In the US, tariff costs are slowly making their way through the economy, but impact on final consumer prices has so far been limited.\n\nSPONSORED Discover the top brokers for trading EUR/USD in 2025.

      "text": "The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) has not performed well in 2025. It is the third worse performing G10 currency in the year to date after the CAD and the USD and the second worst performer after the JPY in the half year to date, Rabobank's FX analyst Jane Foley reports.\n\n\"The poor performance of the NZD this year reflects the easing bias of the RBNZ , New Zealand\u2019s lengthy bout of economic weakness, its links with the weak Chinese economy and the larger than expected 15% Trump trade tariff imposed on the country on August 1. We see risk of short-covering pressure in favour of the USD on a 1-to-3-month view which could result in dips towards the NZD/USD0.58 area. That said, we see a move to the NZD/USD0.61 area on a 12-month view.\"\n\n\"Today\u2019s release of New Zealand\u2019s August food price inflation index will provide economists with a better insight as to whether CPI inflation is likely to remain above the RBNZ\u2019s 1% to 3% target in the current quarter. In July food prices rose by 0.7% m/m (5.0% y/y) following a 1.2% m/m (4.6% y/y) boost in June. In Q2 CPI inflation registered 2.7% y/y. While this was a touch softer than expected, it is clearly well above the RBNZ\u2019s 1% to 3% target. Despite the backdrop of sticky inflation pressures, the consensus view in the market is that RBNZ rates have further to fall \u2013 not least because policymakers have explicitly warned of more easing.\"\n\n\"While the NZD has outperformed the USD this year, this is mostly a function of the poor tone of the greenback. CFTC positioning data highlight that speculators\u2019 have been short USD for months and, while further Fed easing is expected this week, there are a lot of Fed rate cuts already in the price of the greenback over the next 12 months or so. For this reason, we see scope for broad-based pullbacks in favour of the USD in the coming weeks. In view of the weak economic backdrop in New Zealand and the dovish tone of the RBNZ, this indicates there is risk for dips to the NZD/USD0.58 area on a 1-to-3-month view.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Ahead of Wednesday's critical Fed policy announcements, the US Dollar (USD) struggles to find demand and helps the pair hold its ground.\n\nGBP/USD picks up fresh bids and trades at its highest level since early July above 1.3600. Traders resort to position adjustments ahead of the critical Fed and BoE policy announcements due later this week. Meanwhile, the US Dollar\u00a0dynamics and broader market sentiment will continue to drive the GBP/USD price action.\n\nGold rebounds after falling toward $3,620 and trades slightly below $3,650 on Monday. Growing expectations for a dovish tilt in the Fed's policy outlook makes it difficult for the US Dollar to find demand and allows XAU/USD to holds its ground.\n\nInflation is not too hot, but the job market is more worrying \u2013 that is the growing narrative about the US economy. Now, the Federal Reserve\u00a0is set to cut rates, in a decision with many moving parts. And there's more in store.\n\nInflation picked up speed in August across major economies, though still very moderately. Inflation expectations continue to diverge between the US and the rest of the world. In the US, tariff costs are slowly making their way through the economy, but impact on final consumer prices has so far been limited.\n\nSPONSORED Discover the top brokers for trading EUR/USD in 2025.

USD subsequently edged lower, and we highlighted last Friday (12 Sep, spot at 7.1140) that 'there is room for USD to drop below 7.1100.' However, we pointed out that 'given that there has been no significant increase in downward momentum, the pace of any decline is likely to be slow.' We added, 'the major support at 7.1000 may not come into view so soon.' We will maintain the same view as long as 7.1350 (no change \u2018strong resistance\u2019 level) is not breached.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "summary": "The British Pound (GBP) is extending its winning streak against the Japanese Yen (JPY) for the fourth consecutive day on Monday, with the cross trading near its strongest level in more than a year.",
      "text": "The British Pound (GBP) is extending its winning streak against the Japanese Yen (JPY) for the fourth consecutive day on Monday, with the cross trading near its strongest level in more than a year. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY is trading around 200.50, up nearly 0.15% on the day, marking its highest level since July 24, 2024.\n\nThe British Pound is strong across the board at the start of the week, while the Yen remains on the defensive as traders position ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) monetary policy decision on Thursday and the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) policy announcement on Friday.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the cross continues to trade with a clear bullish bias, comfortably holding above both the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 199.23 and the 50-day SMA at 198.80. The sustained break and consolidation above the 200.00 psychological level reinforces the positive momentum, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62.7 pointing to strong upside pressure without reaching overbought territory.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also reinforcing the bullish structure, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line and the histogram printing green bars. This crossover is a fresh bullish signal, suggesting that upside momentum is regaining strength after a period of consolidation.\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is located at the July 24, 2024 peak around 201.18, which if cleared would open the door toward the July 23, 2024 high at 203.16. A decisive break above this zone could pave the way for a broader extension of the uptrend.\n\nOn the downside, the first line of defense is the 200.00 psychological level, with additional support near the 21-day SMA, followed by the 50-day SMA. A break below these zones could trigger a deeper correction toward 197.50, though the broader structure remains constructive while price holds above 200.00.\n\nLooking ahead, UK labour market data on Tuesday and inflation figures on Wednesday will be closely watched for fresh cues on the BoE\u2019s policy stance, while in Japan, CPI figures due Friday ahead of the BoJ decision could provide additional volatility for the Yen.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies today. British Pound was the strongest against the US Dollar.\n\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the British Pound from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent GBP (base)/USD (quote).\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "Barrick Mining Corporation (B Quick) has agreed to sell its Hemlo Gold Mine in Canada to Carcetti Capital Corp. for gross proceeds of up to $1.09 billion, including an $875 million cash consideration. The divestment, which is expected to conclude within the fourth quarter of 2025, marks the end of a successful chapter at Hemlo. The proceeds from the divestment are expected to be used to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to its shareholders.\n\nHemlo, which Barrick has been operating for more than three decades, has produced more than 21 million ounces of gold. Hemlo, which produced 143,000 ounces of gold last year, is Barrick\u2019s last operating mine in Canada \u2014 a key region for Barrick. The company plans to unlock upcoming opportunities in the region through a number of early-stage projects and exploration targets. It will look for opportunities to find and operate world-class gold and copper mines in the country.\n\nBarrick has divested or exited several non-core assets to sharpen its focus on Tier 1 assets. It completed the sale of its 50% interest in the Donlin Gold Project in Alaska in June 2025. It has also agreed to sell the Alturas Project in Chile to a subsidiary of Boroo Pte Ltd (Singapore), with the deal expected to close within the third quarter of 2025. Prior to this, Barrick divested Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines (KCGM) in Australia, the Massawa project in Senegal and Lagunas Norte in Peru, in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nCombined with the sale of Donlin and Alturas, Barrick expects to generate over $2 billion from the divestment of non-core asset sales this year. These funds will support its capital allocation strategy, which focuses on reinforcing its balance sheet and delivering returns to its shareholders.\n\nAmong Barrick\u2019s major peers, Newmont Corporation (NEM) completed its non-core divestiture program in April 2025 with the sale of its Akyem operation in Ghana and its Porcupine operation in Canada. Following the sale of Greatland and Discovery shares, Newmont anticipates generating $3 billion in after-tax cash proceeds from its 2025 divestiture program. These funds will support Newmont\u2019s capital allocation strategy, which focuses on reinforcing its balance sheet and delivering returns to its shareholders.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (KGC) also streamlined its portfolio through the sale of its Russian assets, including the Kupol mine and Udinsk project, in 2022. Kinross also sold its 90% interest in the Chirano mine in Ghana in 2022. With these divestments, Kinross\u2019 rebalanced portfolio now has a strong production profile anchored by Tasiast and Paracatu, its two biggest assets.\n\nBarrick\u2019s shares have gained 87.3% year to date compared with the Zacks\u00a0Mining \u2013 Gold\u00a0industry\u2019s rise of 101.6%, courtesy of the gold price rally.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, B is currently trading at a forward 12-month earnings multiple of 12.81, a roughly 17.8% discount when stacked up with the industry average of 15.59X.

We were incorrect, as USD traded between 147.10 and 148.07, before closing at 147.66 (+0.31%). This time around, there has been a slight increase in upward momentum, and this is likely to lead to USD trading in a higher range of 147.20/148.15.\"\n\n1-3 WEEKS VIEW: \"We have expected USD to trade in a range since early last week. Last Friday (12 Sep, spot at 147.25), we stated that 'we continue to expect range-trading, but a narrower range of 146.20/148.50 is likely enough to contain the price movements for now.'

On Friday, we noted that 'strong momentum indicates likely further strengthening of AUD, but overbought conditions suggest that 0.6700 is likely out of reach for now.' However, instead of strengthening further, AUD traded in a range of 0.6631/0.6668 before settling at 0.6648 (-0.20%). AUD appears to have entered a consolidation phase. Today, we expect AUD to trade in a range between 0.6625 and 0.6665.\"\n\n1-3 WEEKS VIEW: \"We continue to hold the same view as last Friday (12 Sep, spot at 0.6665). As highlighted, the recent 'price action continues to suggest a higher AUD, and the next level to watch above 0.6670 is 0.6700.' Overall, only a breach of 0.6590 (no change in \u2018strong support\u2019 level) would indicate that the AUD strength from early last week (see annotations in chart below) has run its course.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

This is a non-MPR meeting, meaning that there will be no forecast update. We remain CAD bulls on the basis of the outlook for relative central bank policy given that the BoC is much closer to its neutral rate\u2014relative to the Fed.\"\n\n\"For Monday we look to the release of manufacturing sales ahead of Tuesday\u2019s CPI. We\u2019ll also receive international securities transactions data on Wednesday, and retail sales on Friday. Our USD/CAD FV estimate is currently at 1.3638 and a narrower estimate based solely on 2Y US-Canada yield spreads is at 1.3952.\"\n\n\"The RSI reveals neutral momentum just above the 50 level as we note the third attempt at a bearish reversal following similar moves in early August and mid/late August.

      "text": "Pound Sterling (GBP) is likely to trade sideways. Slight increase in upward momentum is not sufficient to indicate a sustained rise, UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia note.\n\n24-HOUR VIEW: \" The following are excerpts from our update last Friday: 'There has been a slight increase in upward momentum. Today, there is a chance for GBP to test the major resistance at 1.3595. A break above this level is not ruled out, but based on the current momentum, GBP is unlikely to be able to maintain a foothold above this level. Support is at 1.3550; a breach of 1.3535 would indicate that the current mild upward pressure has eased.' The subsequent price movements did not turn out as expected. GBP traded in a sideways range of 1.3525/1.3578. Momentum indicators are turning flat, suggesting further sideways trading today, most likely between 1.3525 and 1.3575.\"\n\n1-3 WEEKS VIEW: \"Last Monday (08 Sep, spot at 1.3480), we highlighted that 'the current price movements are likely part of a broad range between 1.3430 and 1.3595.' After GBP rose to a high of 1.3583 and closed at 1.3573 on Thursday, we indicated on Friday (12 Sep, spot at 1.3565) that 'there has been a slight increase in upward momentum, but it is not sufficient to indicate a sustained rise just yet.' We also indicated that GBP 'must break and hold above 1.3595 before a move toward 1.3635 can be expected.' We will continue to hold the same view as long as the \u2018strong support\u2019 level at 1.3510 is not breached.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The Pound Sterling (GBP) advances against the US Dollar (USD) at the start of the week during the European trading session. The GBP/USD pair jumps to near 1.3600as the US Dollar faces selling pressure, with investors awaiting monetary policy announcements by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BoE) on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades marginally down near 97.50.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see a 94,2% chance that the central bank will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.00%-4.25% in the policy announcement on Wednesday. Fed dovish speculation has been intensified due to growing labor market concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the BoE is expected to hold interest rates steady at 4% as inflationary pressures in the United Kingdom (UK) economy are continuing to prove persistent.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the weakest against the British Pound.\n\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\n\nThe Pound Sterling edges higher to near 1.3580 against the US Dollar on Monday. The near-term trend of the Cable remains sideways as it trades close to the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is around 1.3508.\n\nThe Cable trades inside the Ascending Triangle chart pattern, which indicates indecisiveness among investors. The horizontal resistance of the above-mentioned chart pattern is plotted from the July 23 high around 1.3585, while the upward-sloping border is placed from the August 1 low near 1.3140.\n\nThe 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillates inside the 40.00-60.00 range, indicating a sideways trend.\n\nLooking down, the August 1 low of 1.3140 will act as a key support zone. On the upside, the July 1 high near 1.3800 will act as a key barrier.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

EZ-US yield spreads are steady at their recent highs, and the euro area bond market remains quiescent despite Fitch\u2019s cut to France\u2019s credit rating (A+ from AA-) on Friday.\"\n\n\"France\u2019s 10Y yield continues to trade in tandem with Italy\u2019s. In terms of data, the euro area trade balance (for July) came in lower than expected, and the highlight of this week will be Tuesday\u2019s ZEW investor sentiment. The ECB speaking calendar is heavy, with President Lagarde scheduled to speak on both Monday and Tuesday.\"\n\n\"We are bullish following last week\u2019s break of descending resistance. The renewed bullishness has us looking to a break of Tuesday\u2019s high in the upper 1.17s, targeting 1.18 followed by a possible push to fresh multi-year highs.

      "text": "European Central Bank (ECB) board member Isabel Schnabel said on Tuesday that interest rates in the Eurozone are in a good place and added that upside risks to inflation continue to dominate.\n\nSchnabel further argued that the pass-through from a stronger Euro (EUR) is likely to be limited.\n\nRegarding the economic outlook , she said the growth is likely to exceed the potential, with domestic demand counteracting falling exports.\n\nEUR/USD clings to modest daily gains and trades above 1.1750 following these comments.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region.\nThe ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa.\nThe ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde.\n\nIn extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets \u2013 usually government or corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro.\nQE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic.\n\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The Euro gave away gains from the previous two trading days on Monday, extending its reversal from Friday\u2019s high above 0.8660 to a fresh two-week low at 0.8632, weighed by Fitch\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s sovereign ratings. The ratings agency announced over the weekend its decision to cut the ranking of France\u2019s debt to A+, its lowest level on record, as the political crisis weakens the country\u2019s ability to implement the necessary measures to avoid further escalation of its ballooning debt.\n\nFrance is grappling with an unstable political situation, as President Macron just named Sebastien Lecornu, the third Prime Minister of his term. Lecornu replaces Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who was toppled after a plan to reduce spending was refused by the parliament.\n\nThe pair, however, is failing to capitalise on the Euro downtrend, facing weaknesses of its own. The sharp contraction in July\u2019s manufacturing production brought July\u2019s GDP to stagnation levels.\n\nThe BoE is meeting on Thursday and is widely expected to leave its Repo Rate on hold at the current 4% but further evidence of an economic downturn \u2013Unemployment levels are out on Tuesday\u2013 is likely to boost hopes of more rate cuts to come and might increase pressure on the Sterling.\n\nThe Bank of England (BoE) decides monetary policy for the United Kingdom. Its primary goal is to achieve \u2018price stability\u2019, or a steady inflation rate of 2%. Its tool for achieving this is via the adjustment of base lending rates. The BoE sets the rate at which it lends to commercial banks and banks lend to each other, determining the level of interest rates in the economy overall. This also impacts the value of the Pound Sterling (GBP).\n\nWhen inflation is above the Bank of England\u2019s target it responds by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is positive for the Pound Sterling because higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls below target, it is a sign economic growth is slowing, and the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit in the hope businesses will borrow to invest in growth-generating projects \u2013 a negative for the Pound Sterling.\n\nIn extreme situations, the Bank of England can enact a policy called Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the BoE substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. QE is a last resort policy when lowering interest rates will not achieve the necessary result. The process of QE involves the BoE printing money to buy assets \u2013 usually government or AAA-rated corporate bonds \u2013 from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Pound Sterling.\n\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE, enacted when the economy is strengthening and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the Bank of England (BoE) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to encourage them to lend; in QT, the BoE stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive for the Pound Sterling.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The US Dollar (USD) is entering the week with a defensive posture and trading with broad weakness against all of the G10 currencies, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret report.\n\n\"The GBP is outperforming with a 0.3% gain, ahead of a data-heavy (jobs, CPI) week that also includes Thursday\u2019s BoE (exp. hold). Skandies NOK and SEK are also leading their peers, and extending their gains to fresh multi-year highs vs. the USD. The JPY is once again trading above its 50 day MA and continues to exhibit a tentatively bullish posture as we approach Friday\u2019s BoJ\u2014a widely anticipated hold, albeit one that is expected to deliver a hawkish tone with a clear intention to raise rates in either October or December.\"\n\n\"The EUR continues to build on last week\u2019s ECB-driven gains and is likely to remain well supported through Wednesday\u2019s Fed. The relative underperformance of AUD, CAD, MXN and NZD may hint to some concerns about the quality of the broader market\u2019s tone. In equities , the (S&P 500) e-minis are looking well supported trading just below Friday\u2019s record high while US yields appear to be stabilizing just above last week\u2019s lows\u2014the 10Y having found support around 4% and the having bounced at 3.5%. The price of crude (WTI) is once again attempting stabilization around $62.50/bbl and the price of copper looks well supported as it consolidates last week\u2019s rally to a fresh recovery high.\"\n\n\"Gold prices are also consolidating, appearing to tread water ahead of this week\u2019s main risk event\u2014Wednesday\u2019s FOMC. The Fed is widely expected to deliver a 25bpt rate cut, to 4.25%, and the tone is expected to lean dovish given expectations for a series of cuts as markets are pricing a cumulative 70bpts of easing by year-end and just shy of 150bpts by year-end 2026. For Monday, the NA release calendar is relatively light and limited to the Empire manufacturing survey at 8:30am ET. There are no scheduled Fed speakers, given the blackout period ahead of Wednesday.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The NZD/USD pair edges higher to near 0.5960 during the late European trading session on Monday. The Kiwi pair gains marginally as the US Dollar (USD) faces selling pressure amid firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates in the monetary policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the press time, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades 0.2% lower to near 97.40.\n\nAccording to the CME Fedwatch tool, traders have fully priced in that the Fed will cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nFed dovish expectations have been prompted by growing United States (US) labor market concerns. Last week, Initial Jobless Claims data for the week ending September 5 showed that individuals claiming jobless benefits came in highest in four years at 263K.\n\nAs the Fed is widely anticipated to cut interest rates on Wednesday, investors will pay close attention to cues regarding the monetary policy outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook of the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) remains uncertain as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is loosen its monetary policy further. According to a report from Reuters, the RBNZ will reduce its Official Cash Rate (OCR) two times in the remainder of the year. The RBNZ has already reduced its OCR 125 basis points to 3% this year.\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) is the official currency of the United States of America, and the \u2018de facto\u2019 currency of a significant number of other countries where it is found in circulation alongside local notes. It is the most heavily traded currency in the world, accounting for over 88% of all global foreign exchange turnover, or an average of $6.6 trillion in transactions per day, according to data from 2022.\nFollowing the second world war, the USD took over from the British Pound as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For most of its history, the US Dollar was backed by Gold, until the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when the Gold Standard went away.\n\nThe most important single factor impacting on the value of the US Dollar is monetary policy, which is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability (control inflation) and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these two goals is by adjusting interest rates.\nWhen prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the Fed will raise rates, which helps the USD value. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates, which weighs on the Greenback.\n\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve can also print more Dollars and enact quantitative easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system.\nIt is a non-standard policy measure used when credit has dried up because banks will not lend to each other (out of the fear of counterparty default). It is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the necessary result. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice to combat the credit crunch that occurred during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy US government bonds predominantly from financial institutions. QE usually leads to a weaker US Dollar.\n\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing in new purchases. It is usually positive for the US Dollar.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "After a nine-month pause, the US Federal Reserve is expected to resume its cycle of interest rate cuts this week. The big question is how far will it go? US President Trump has already made it clear that he wants to see cuts to a key interest rate of around 1% (from the current 4.25-4.50%), and probably as quickly as possible. Given the risk of stagflation in the wake of US tariffs, such a sharp easing of monetary policy would be disastrous for the US Dollar (USD), Commerzbank's Head of FX and Commodity Research Thu Lan Nguyen notes.\n\n\"Trump's motives are clear. He\u00a0pointed out himself that the Treasury would save USD 1 trillion if interest rates fell to such a low level. In other words, he wants the Fed to help the Treasury finance the national debt. The technical term for this is 'fiscal dominance'. In this case, monetary policy is not primarily guided by the mandate of price stability (and maximum employment), but by the affordability of government debt. This causes the central bank to lose credibility, which in the worst case can lead to a significant increase in inflation expectations and ultimately to currency destabilization.\"\n\n\"Both Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who is leading the search for a new Fed chair, and\u00a0Stephen Miran, who could take Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's place on the FOMC as early as this week, have in the past, or in Bessent's case\u00a0only recently, expressed criticism of an instrument that is important for fiscal dominance. Namely, QE (quantitative easing), the central bank's asset purchases. Miran criticized that the use of QE to combat the Great Financial Crisis had not been subject to political oversight. Bessent even questions the effectiveness of QE and points to unintended side effects.\"\n\n\"Bessent's views in particular could have important implications. He argues that QE should only be used in crisis situations and should be halted as soon as they end. This could indicate that Bessent is in favor of a faster reduction of the Fed's balance sheet. The central bank has already significantly reduced its balance sheet following the pandemic in order to combat accelerating inflation. However, the pace of reduction has slowed again since spring this year. A return to faster reduction, especially of government bond holdings, would reduce the effectiveness of the interest rate cuts demanded by Trump \u2013 which in turn would benefit the US dollar.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

That is why investors utilize gold as a stabilizer. Investors rely on gold's strength in tough times to limit unrealized losses in equities and inflation-related reductions in purchasing power of cash deposits. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing play out now before our eyes.\n\nGold is also a widely recognized store of value. As such, the precious metal can potentially stand in as a medium of exchange if the dollar collapses.\n\n\u201cI recommend that everyone buy a little gold as a hedge against calamity,\u201d said Scott Travers, author of The Coin Collector's Survival Manual and editor of \"COINage\" magazine, in an interview with Bottom Line, Inc. Gold \u201cshould be viewed as an insurance policy,\u201d he said.\n\nLearn more: How to invest in gold in four steps\n\nWhether you\u2019re tracking the price of gold since last month or last year, the price-of-gold chart below shows the precious metal\u2019s steady upward climb in value.\n\nHistorically, gold has shown extended up cycles and down cycles. The precious metal was in a growth phase from 2009 to 2011. It then trended down, failing to set a new high for nine years.\n\nIn those lackluster years for gold, your position will negatively impact your overall investment returns. If that feels problematic, a lower allocation percentage is more appropriate. On the other hand, you may be willing to accept gold's underperforming years so you can benefit more in the good years. In this case, you can target a higher percentage.\n\nThe precious metal has been in the news lately, and many analysts are bullish on gold. In May, Goldman Sachs Research predicted gold would reach $3,700 a troy ounce by year-end 2025. That would equate to a 40% increase for the year, based on gold\u2019s January 2 opening price of $2,633. Rising demand from central banks, along with uncertainty related to changing U.S. tariff policy, are the factors driving the increase.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about gold\u2019s historical value, Yahoo Finance has been tracking the historical price of gold since 2000.\n\nJobless claims measure how many people filed for unemployment benefits.

      "text": "The USD/JPY pair falls sharply to near 147.30 during the European trading session on Monday. The pair faces selling pressure as the US Dollar (USD) underperforms its peers amid firm expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start the monetary-easing campaign on Wednesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback\u2019s value against six major currencies, trades 0.2% lower to near 97.40.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, traders have fully priced in an interest rate reduction by the Fed in the policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nFed dovish speculation has been intensified due to escalating United States (US) labor market risks. A report from Morgan Stanley also showed that the Fed will cut interest rates in each of its monetary policy meetings remaining this year amid slowing job demand.\n\nThis week, investors will also focus on the US Retail Sales data for August, which is scheduled for Tuesday. The Retail Sales data is expected to have grown at a moderate pace of 0.3%.\n\nGoing forward, the major trigger for the Japanese Yen (JPY) will be the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) monetary policy announcement on Friday. The BoJ is expected to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%, while keeping the door open for more interest rate hikes.\n\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.\nWhen prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money.\nWhen inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions.\nThe FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials \u2013 the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system.\nIt is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed\u2019s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\n\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The EUR/USD pair trades at right above, ahead of Monday's US session opening, after bouncing at 1.1720 lows earlier in the day.\u00a0The common currency opened the week on a hesitant note but is gathering momentum as the market shifts its focus from France's political crisis to the US Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy meeting due on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, the Fitch rating agency downgraded France's debt ranking to A+, its lowest level on record, citing its uncertain political situation \u2013 President Emmanuelle Macron named Sebastien Lecornu as the third Prime Minister of his term last week \u2013, and a fiscal deficit that is only expected to continue growing. The impact of Fitch's announcement on the Euro (EUR) has been limited, as the Fed's decision remains front and center in financial markets. Investors have already priced in a 25 basis points cut, but the interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference are likely to reveal changes in the forward guidance that might determine the US Dollar's near-term direction.\n\nThe macroeconomic docket is light on Monday. ECB President Lagarde will take part in a panel at the Institute Montaigne in Paris, and during the European afternoon, Isabel Schnabel will speak at an economic meeting in Luxembourg. Their comments about France's situation and the bank's next monetary policy plans are likely to provide some guidance for the Euro.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change of Euro (EUR) against listed major currencies today. Euro was the strongest against the US Dollar.\n\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Euro from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent EUR (base)/USD (quote).\n\nEUR/USD has resumed its bullish trend, extending gains beyond the 1.1750 resistance level. US Dollar's weakness is contributing to the Euro rally, but a significant rally looks unlikely as investors will remain wary of keeping larger USD shorts, heading into a key Fed meeting.\n\nIf bulls manage to consolidate at current levels, the next upside target would be the 1.1780-1.1790 area (September 8, July 24 highs). Beyond here, the top of the ascending channel meets the July 1 high at the 1.1830 area.\n\nTo the downside, Friday's low near 1.1700, and the bottom of the channel, at 1.1675, are likely to challenge bears in the coming sessions. Further down, the September 11 low near 1.1660 comes into view ahead of the 1.1610-1.1630 area that encloses the lows of September 2,3, and 4.\n\nMonetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

Corporate bond yields have headed lower as well, and at a faster rate than Treasury yields. As a consequence, spreads between corporate and Treasury bond yields have tightened in recent months, remaining narrower than historical averages. For example, the spread between AAA-rated corporate bonds and 10-year government bonds in August was 109 basis points (bps), down from 114 bps in May but still lower than the historical average of 122 bps.  The gap between the government 10-year bond yield and a BAA-rated bond (still investment grade) in August was 174 basis points, below the historical average spread of 228 bps but narrower by about 15 bps since the spring. We watch these spreads closely for several reasons. First, from an asset-allocation standpoint, tight corporate bond spreads signal that corporate bond prices are above historical fair value, and we may look to under-weight the segment in our model portfolios. As well, from a broad market standpoint, the changes in the spreads offer clues to the bond market's view of corporate financial strength -- which a\n\nExclusive reports, detailed company profiles, and best-in-class trade insights to take your portfolio to the next level\n\nDaily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 09/15/2025\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\n\u2022\n\nFCPT, ENVA, KDP, ZLAB, CPNG, RIOT, EVLV, IVZ, AARD, THC\n\nDaily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 09/10/2025\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\u2022\n\nJOE, DHI, NAUT, DLTR, SEI, KURA, CRBG, AMG, TNGX, AXSM\n\nCELH: Lowering target price to $59.00\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\u2022\n\nCELH\n\nDLTR: Lowering target price to $101.00\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\u2022\n\nDLTR\n\nIDXX: Raising target price to $721.00\n\nSep 10, 2025\n\n\u2022\n\nIDXX",

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSummary\n\nThe FOMC is expected to cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 4%-4.25%, this in one of the most talked-about and anticipated rate cuts in recent memory. Some have speculated that the recent strength in the stock market is attributed mostly to the upcoming cut. If so, will investors then sell the news and take profits? That certainly could be, but the short-term market direction likely will be guided by Chairman Powell's press conference. How dovish or hawkish will he sound regarding future rate cuts?   According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 76% chance that we will see three 25-bps cuts by the last meeting on December 10, with a target of 3.50%-3.75%. Our favored method for determining what the Fed \"should\" do is to look at the two-year Treasury yield, which sits at 3.56%. That implies the market believes the Fed is about 82 basis points behind in the current cutting cycle and aligns nicely with the CME tool.  Last week was another good period for stocks, with the S&P 500 rising 1.6%, the S&P 100 and the Nasdaq tacking on 2%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 popping 2.4%, and the Nasdaq 100 gaining 1.8%.

The USDollar Index, which measures the value of the US Dollar against the most traded currencies, extends losses on Monday, following a period of hesitation, as speculation about a \u201cdovish cut\u201d by the Fed increases.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the hourly chart shows an increasing bearish momentum after the pair\u2019s failure at the  0.7970 area earlier today. Price action shows a descending wedge. This pattern suggests a potential bullish outcome, but so far, bears have the upper hand. On the downside, a key support area emerges between the September 11 low, at 0.7950, and the wedge bottom, now around 0.7940. Further down, the next target would be the September 9 low, at 0.7915. A rebound from current levels, on the other hand, would be tested at the intraday high, near 0.7970, and Friday\u2019s high, at 0,7985. Further up, the Wedge\u2019s target would be the September 11 high, at 0.8005.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies today. US Dollar was the strongest against the Canadian Dollar.\n\nThe heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)/JPY (quote).\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "A public holiday in Japan has seen a quiet start to the week in global FX markets. In terms of overnight news , there were note some\u00a0soft China activity data that calls out for some more stimulus. One can also note the rally in Korean asset markets after the government scrapped a planned lowering in the threshold for the capital gains tax. This has dragged USD/KRW away from 1400 again, ING's FX analyst Chris Turner notes.\n\n\"Looking ahead, it's a big week for central bank meetings. Five of the G10 central banks are meeting, and three of them are expected to cut. The highlight, of course, is\u00a0Wednesday's FOMC meeting. We and a strong consensus are looking for a 25bp cut, then two further 25bp cuts in October and December. The market currently prices 68bp of the 75bp in expected cuts this year. We see the dollar staying gently offered into the meeting, and it could sell off a little further should a 50bp cut at the meeting prove a closer call than most expect.\"\n\n\"Beyond the FOMC meetings, highlights of this week's US calendar are Tuesday's release of August retail sales data and Thursday's release of weekly jobless claims and July Treasury International Capital (TIC) data. Last week's jump in jobless claims briefly hit the dollar, and the TIC data will be scrutinised for any signs that foreign investors are not just hedging US assets, but outright selling them.\"\n\n\"We still think there are some seasonal effects keeping the dollar gently supported, but this week's FOMC should set the tone into the fourth quarter. Expect DXY to continue trading in a tight 97.20-98.00 range until Wednesday evening.\"\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSummary\n\nWall Street is convinced that an interest-rate cut is coming this week. Recent data confirms weakness in the labor market and very likely has forced the Fed into a move on rates -- even as other data shows a slow creep higher in inflation. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.95%, the S&P 500 gained 1.6%, and the Nasdaq was up 2.0%. So far this year, the Dow is up 7.7%, the S&P 500 11.9%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 14.6%.  On the economic calendar, 'Fed Day' is Wednesday and odds for a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut are at 93%, while odds for a 50-bps are at 7%, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. Meanwhile, Retail Sales, Industrial Production, and Capacity Utilization are due out on Tuesday; Housing Starts on Wednesday; and Leading Economic Indicators on Thursday. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure calls for GDP of 3.1% in the third quarter. That is a tick higher than the forecast from last week. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast predicts a 3.0% rate for CPI in September, also a tick higher than last week. Mortgage rates fell 15 basis points last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.35%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices rose a penny to an average of $3.19 per gallon for regular gas.  Looking ahead, after the Fed's meeting this week, the next interest-rate decision comes on October 29. Odds are at 80% for a second 25-basis-point rate cut, again according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the last meeting of the year is on December 10, and odds are at 74% for a third 25-basis-point cut.  Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the ETF EFA, has surged 23% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 25%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 13% (ETF IWF), have taken the edge over value stocks (ETF IWD), which have booked an advance of 10%.

See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nToday\u2019s savings account rates still hover well above the national average. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate three times in 2024, which means deposit account rates are also on the decline. It's more important than ever to ensure you're earning the highest rate possible on your savings, and a high-yield savings account could be the solution.\n\nThese accounts pay more interest than the typical savings account \u2014 as much as 4% APY and higher in some cases. Not sure where to find the best savings interest rates today? Read on to find out which banks have the best offers.\n\nIn general, high-yield savings accounts offer better interest rates than traditional savings accounts . Still, rates vary widely across financial institutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to shop around and compare rates before opening an account.\n\nAs of September 15, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.30% APY. This rate is offered by EverBank and Western Alliance.\n\nAs you'll see, the majority of top savings rates come from online banks . These institutions have much lower overhead costs than traditional banks, so they can pass those savings on to customers in the form of higher rates and lower fees.\n\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\n\nA high-yield savings account can be a good fit if you\u2019re looking for a secure place to store your money and earn a competitive interest rate while maintaining liquidity. Traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have some of the highest interest rates we\u2019ve seen in more than a decade, thanks to recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Even so, the national average for these rates is fairly low compared to the top offers available.\n\nFor example, the average savings account rate is just 0.39%, while 1-year CDs pay 1.76%, on average, according to the FDIC. The Fed is also expected to lower its target rate again in 2025, which means now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of today\u2019s high rates.\n\nTaking the time to compare accounts and rates from various financial institutions will help you secure the best deal available. However, interest rates aren\u2019t the only factor to consider when choosing a savings account.\n\nFor example, some banks may require that you maintain a minimum balance to earn the highest advertised rate and avoid monthly fees. Other factors to evaluate include customer service options and hours, ATM and branch access, digital banking tools, and the overall financial stability of the institution. Additionally, before opening a savings account, be sure that it\u2019s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \u2014 or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) if it\u2019s held by a credit union \u2014 so your money is protected in case the institution fails.\n\nRead more: How to open a savings account: A step-by-step guide\n\nIs it possible to find savings accounts with interest rates of 4% or more? See which banks currently offer 4% interest savings accounts and open an account today.\n\nDo high-yield savings account rates change often? And why do banks raise or lower their rates?

However, in general, today\u2019s average CD rates represent some of the highest seen in nearly two decades, largely due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation by keeping interest rates elevated.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about opening a CD , it\u2019s important to choose one with a high APY and term length that matches your financial goals. Here are some tips for finding the best CD rates and accounts that match your needs:\n\nShop around: It\u2019s a good idea to evaluate CD rates from a variety of financial institutions and compare your options before settling on an account. You can easily compare CD rates online.\n\nConsider online banks: Online banks tend to have lower overhead costs, which allows them to offer higher interest rates on CDs. In fact, online banks often have the most competitive rates available.\n\nCheck minimum deposit requirements: Higher CD rates might come with higher minimum deposit requirements, so make sure the amount you plan to deposit aligns with the requirements to get the best rate.\n\nReview account terms and conditions: Beyond the CD\u2019s rate, look at terms for early withdrawal penalties and auto-renewal policies. Some CDs offer better terms for flexibility, such as no-penalty CDs , which allow you to withdraw your funds without a fee before the maturity date.\n\nWe identified the best CD rates and accounts available today based on interest rates, fees, and more.

Here's a look at the best limited-time CD rates available now.\n\nStep-up CDs increase the interest rate at regular intervals throughout the CD\u2019s term. However, you will likely find better interest rates on your savings elsewhere. Here\u2019s what to know about step-up CDs.\n\nThere are many types of CDs on the market, all of which come with their own advantages and drawbacks.

See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nFind out which banks are offering the top rates. Money market accounts (MMAs) can be a great place to store your cash if you're looking for a relatively high interest rate along with liquidity and flexibility.\n\nUnlike traditional savings accounts, MMAs typically offer better returns, and they may also provide check-writing privileges and debit card access. This makes these accounts ideal for holding long-term savings that you want to grow over time, but can still access when needed for certain purchases or bills.\n\nEven though rates have been falling over the past several months, it's still possible to find money market accounts that pay more than 4% APY.\n\nHere is a look at some of today's best money market account rates:\n\nInterested in earning the best possible interest rate on your savings balance? Here is a look at some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.\n\nMoney market account rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years, largely due to changes in the Federal Reserve's target interest rate.\n\nIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, for example, interest rates were kept extremely low to stimulate the economy. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate to near zero, which led to very low MMA rates. During this time, money market account rates were typically around 0.10% to 0.50%, with many accounts offering rates on the lower end of that range.\n\nEventually, the Fed began raising interest rates gradually as the economy improved. This led to higher yields on savings products, including MMAs. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a brief but sharp recession, and the Fed once again cut its benchmark rate to near zero to combat the economic fallout. This resulted in a sharp decline in MMA rates.\n\nBut starting in 2022, the Fed embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation. This led to historically high deposit rates across the board. By late 2023, money market account rates had risen substantially, with many accounts offering 4% or higher. However, the Fed finally began cutting rates in late 2024.\n\nAs of 2025, MMA rates remain high by historical standards, though they've begun a downward trajectory following the Fed's most recent rate cuts. Today, online banks and credit unions tend to offer the highest rates.\n\nWhen comparing money market accounts, it's important to look beyond just the interest rate. Other factors, such as minimum balance requirements, fees, and withdrawal limits, can impact the total value you get from the account.\n\nFor example, it's common for money market accounts to require a large minimum balance in order to earn the highest advertised rate \u2014 as much as $5,000 or more in some cases. Other accounts may charge monthly maintenance fees that can eat into your interest earnings.\n\nHowever, there are several MMAs available that offer competitive rates without any balance requirements, fees, or other restrictions. That's why it's important to shop around and compare accounts before making a decision.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the account you choose is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per institution, per depositor. Most money market accounts are federally insured, but it's important to double-check in the rare case the financial insitution fails.\n\nRead more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is best for you?\n\nThe national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.59%, according to the FDIC. However, the best money market account rates often pay around 4% to 4.50% APY \u2014 similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts .\n\nThe amount you will earn on $50,000 in a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY) and the time period you leave the money in the account. For example, if you deposit $50,000 into a money market account that pays 4.5% APY and left it in your account for one year, you'd earn $2,303 in interest.\n\nThere are currently no money market accounts that pay 5% APY. However, some high-yield savings accounts from online banks do. You can also check with your local bank or credit union to find out if they offer a 5% APY account that fits your needs.",

      "text": "In this article\n\nAfter Swedish payments group Klarna's $17 billion initial public offering , investors are pondering which big fintech name will be the next to go public.\n\nKlarna popped as much as 30% on the day of its New York IPO, before settling to close around 15% higher. The stock declined further to $42.92\u00a0by Friday but is still up about 7% from its IPO price of $40.\n\nThe debut demonstrated how Wall Street is becoming more welcoming of bumper fintech listings. Prior to Klarna, online trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish all went public to a positive first-day reception.\n\nGemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, surged 14% in its IPO Friday.\n\n\"I think the Klarna IPO would be viewed positively by some of the other scaled-up vendors,\" Gautam Pillai, head of fintech research at British investment bank Peel Hunt, told CNBC.\n\nThere's a crowded pipeline of fintech names that could be next to IPO after Klarna. CNBC looks at which companies look the most promising.\n\nDigital payments firm Stripe has for years been viewed as an IPO contender. Stripe has remained a private company in the 15 years since it was founded, and founders and brothers John and Patrick Collison have long resisted pressure to take the business public.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean a stock market listing hasn't been on Stripe's mind. The Collisons told employees in 2023 that Stripe would decide to either go public or allow employees to sell shares via a secondary offering within the next year.\n\nUltimately, Stripe in January opted for a secondary share sale valuing the company at $91.5 billion \u2014 close to its peak valuation of $95 billion, which it achieved in 2021.\n\nThat doesn't mean Stripe couldn't still pursue a stock market debut further down the line. Many fintech unicorn CEOs have been keeping a close eye on Klarna's IPO performance for signs of when will be the right moment to list.\n\nRevolut is widely seen as a potential future fintech IPO candidate. The digital banking unicorn told CNBC last week that it recently gave employees the chance to sell shares on the secondary market at a whopping $75 billion valuation, placing it above some major U.K. banks by market value.\n\n\"As part of our commitment to our employees, we regularly provide opportunities for them to gain liquidity,\" a Revolut spokesperson told CNBC at the time. \"An employee secondary share sale is currently in process, and we won't be commenting further until it is complete.\"\n\nThe secondary round buys Revolut some time to remain private for longer while still offering staff the chance to exit some of their holdings. At the same time, though, it now makes Revolut one of the world's most valuable private fintech firms.\n\nAs to where Revolut lists, for now the U.S. appears the likeliest location.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky has spoken candidly about his preference to list in the U.S. due to issues with London's IPO market. Last year, he told the 20VC podcast that it was \"just not rational\" to go public in the U.K.\n\nHaving recently reached a $5.9 billion valuation in a secondary share sale, British digital bank Monzo is another contender for the public markets.\n\nA report surfaced earlier this year from Sky News that said Monzo had lined up bankers to work on an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of 2026.\n\nHowever, in a fireside discussion moderated by CNBC at SXSW London, Monzo CEO TS Anil said that an IPO is \"not the thing we're focused on right now\" \u2014 it's worth noting though that this was back in June.\n\n\"The thing we're focused on is scale the business, continue to grow it, double it again, reach more customers, build more products, continue to drive great economic outcomes on the back of that,\" Anil said at the time.\n\nAnil wouldn't comment on where Monzo would list if it were to IPO, but he stressed the firm was \"deeply committed\" to being globally headquartered in London.\n\nMonzo's rival neobank Starling Bank has reportedly been considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as part of expansion plans there.\n\nOn Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Starling had hired Jody Bhagat, former president of global banking at software firm Personetics Technologies, to lead the growth of its Engine technology unit in the U.S.\n\nStarling declined to comment when asked by CNBC about its listing plans.\n\nLast year, Starling's CEO Raman Bhatia talked up the bank's plans to expand globally via Engine, a software platform that Starling sells to other companies so they can set up their own digital banks.\n\n\"I am very bullish about this approach around internationalization of what is the best of Starling \u2014 the proprietary tech,\" Bhatia said during a fireside chat at the Money 20/20 conference moderated by CNBC.\n\nStarling was last privately valued at \u00a32.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in a 2022 funding round. However, reports indicate the firm is looking to fetch a valuation of \u00a34 billion in an upcoming secondary share sale.\n\nThough a lesser known name, Bulgaria-founded fintech firm Payhawk also has IPO ambitions.\n\nThe spend management platform was valued at $1 billion in 2022 and saw revenue surge 85% year-over-year in 2024 to 23.4 million euros ($27.4 million).\n\n\"We're definitely seeing the IPO window open,\" Payhawk CEO and co-founder Hristo Borisov told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. However, he stressed that \"we are looking at more of a five-year horizon there.\"\n\n\"If you look at the majority of the IPOs, the majority of those IPOs are companies with $400 million to $500 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue],\" Borisov said. \"That's our goal.\"\n\nThere are other fintechs that look like potential IPO contenders further down the line \u2014 but the trajectory looks less clear.\n\nBlockchain firm Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC in January last year that the company explored markets outside the U.S. for its IPO due to an aggressive crypto enforcement regime under ex-Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler.\n\nThat could change now thanks to President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance. Garlinghouse said last year though that Ripple had put any plans for an IPO on hold. The startup was most recently valued at $15 billion .\n\nGermany's N26 is another potential IPO contender. The digital bank was valued at $9 billion in a 2021 funding round .\n\nHowever, it has faced some setbacks. N26 co-founder Valentin Stalf recently stepped down as CEO after facing pressure from investors over regulatory failings.",

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSome offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nHELOC interest rates currently range from 8.05% to 9.59% APR. Yet you may see promotional home equity line of credit rates that are much lower. Those introductory rates are usually offered for up to one year. Then, the variable rate discussed here kicks in.\n\nDig deeper: Is now a good time to take out a HELOC?\n\nAccording to Bank of America , the largest HELOC lender in the country, today's average APR on a 10-year draw HELOC is 8.72% . That is a variable rate that kicks in after a six-month introductory APR, which is 6.49% in most parts of the country.\n\nHomeowners have a huge amount of value tied up in their houses \u2014 more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record.\n\nWith mortgage rates lingering just over 6%, homeowners may not want to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling the house may not be an option. Why give up your 5%, 4% \u2014 or even 3% mortgage?\n\nAccessing some of the value locked into your house with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.\n\nHELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%.\n\nLenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan , so it pays to shop around. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home.\n\nAnd average national HELOC rates can include \"introductory\" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.\n\nYou don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage , such as a home equity line of credit.\n\nThe best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.\n\nMeanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.\n\nToday, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC rate of 6.49% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.\n\nThe power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.\n\nRates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.\n\nFor homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation \u2014 if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.\n\nIf you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate beginning at 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time.\n\nHome equity lines of credit (HELOCs) usually charge variable rates, but you can find fixed-rate HELOCs with certain lenders. Learn how a fixed-rate HELOC works.\n\nLearn how to use a HELOC to pay off your mortgage faster as well as the pros and cons and alternative methods.\n\nLearn how to get a HELOC with bad credit. If you have a lot of home equity or a low debt-to-income ratio, lenders may still accept your application.\n\nTo get a HELOC, you must meet equity, credit score, and DTI ratio requirements and then go through the application process. Learn more about how to get a HELOC.\n\nIf you\u2019re burdened by loan payments, using a HELOC to pay off debt could save you big in interest. But it\u2019s not for everyone. See if this option is for you.\n\nA HELOC draw period is when you can withdraw money from your line of credit, typically lasting 10 years. Find out how the draw period and repayment timeline work.",

      "text": "Warning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts\n\nA man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation.\n\nCharles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (\u00a3740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to.\n\nRumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative expos\u00e9s of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.\n\nOur BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.\n\nYoung Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels.\n\nAt least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network.\n\nMr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.\n\nWe have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.\n\nMr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n\nOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda.\n\nShe found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022.\n\n\"[His] place was like a market\u2026 There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us.\n\nMonic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.\n\n\"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him \u00a32,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled.\n\n\"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia.\n\n\"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\"\n\nMonic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (\u00a319,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n\nMia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes.\n\n\"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly.\n\nAnother woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent.\n\n\"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, \u00a33,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, \u00a31,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces.\n\nHer experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish.\n\n\"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\"\n\nLexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\"\n\nWe put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply.\n\nLexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n\nFinding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media.\n\nBut through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle.\n\nTo corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties.\n\nMr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n\n\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded\u2026 they can do pretty much everything.\"\n\nHe explained the cost - from $1,000 (\u00a3738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\".\n\nWhen asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded\u2026 I will send you the craziest I have.\"\n\nIn the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006.\n\nHe went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business.\n\n\"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it\u2026 it's become part of me.\"\n\nTroy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n\nHe says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients.\n\n\"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy\u2026 [the women] have no escape route\u2026They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\"\n\nMr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork.\n\nOn 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months.\n\nAccording to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network.\n\n\"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says.\n\nMonic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n\nMonic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers.\n\nPolice told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says.\n\nHe obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her.\n\nBut a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss.\n\nMichael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed.\n\nHe says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients.\n\nHe claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine\u2026 There is no way you are going to report me\u2026 Embassy is me, I'm the embassy.\n\n\"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael.\n\nMia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it.\n\nMonic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa.\n\nThe phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n\nKayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death.\n\nWhile Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned.\n\nOur investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies.\n\nMonic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf.\n\nAs Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (\u00a3885m) of tax revenue to the country each year.\n\nBut these opportunities can carry a risk.\n\nMariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf.\n\n\"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n\nFor Monic's family, grief is now tangled with fear. Fear for other families who could suffer the same loss they have, if nothing is done.\n\n\"We are all looking at Monica's death,\" her relative Michael told us. \"But who is there for the girls still alive? They're still there. Still suffering.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Charles \"Abbey\" Mwesigwa to respond to all the allegations made in our investigation. He denied running an illegal prostitution ring.\n\nHe said: \"These are all false allegations.\n\n\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it.\"\n\nHe also said: \"[Monic] died with her passport meaning no-one was demanding her money for taking her. Prior to her death, I hadn't seen her for over four to five weeks.\n\n\"I knew [Monic and Kayla] and [they] were renting with different landlords. If no-one in both flats was arrested or any of the landlords, then there was a reason. Both incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and maybe they can help you.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Al Barsha Police Station to request to see the case files for Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi. It did not respond to that request or to allegations Monica and Kayla's deaths had not been properly investigated.\n\nThe BBC was unable to see any toxicology reports in relation to Monic Karungi, or speak to the landlord of the apartment in which she was living when she died.",

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSome offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nThis could be an interesting week for mortgage rates. While they have moved lower in recent weeks, the last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, mortgage rates actually moved higher.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the current 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.28%. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.49% . If you can get a similar rate from a lender, this might be a good time to buy a house and lock in a relatively low rate.\n\nRead next: The best mortgage lenders for low and no down payments\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.28%\n\n20-year fixed: 5.78%\n\n15-year fixed: 5.49%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.58%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.55%\n\n30-year VA: 5.69%\n\n15-year VA: 5.16%\n\n5/1 VA: 5.81%\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn more: 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\n30-year fixed: 6.10%\n\n20-year fixed: 5.67%\n\n15-year fixed: 5.40%\n\n5/1 ARM: 6.22%\n\n7/1 ARM: 6.16%\n\n30-year VA: 5.70%\n\n15-year VA: 5.16%\n\n5/1 VA: 5.35%\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nRead more: The best mortgage refinance lenders right now\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nBut if you want a quick, simple way to see how today's rates would impact your monthly mortgage payment, try out the calculator below:\n\nToday\u2019s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.28%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.28% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,853, and you\u2019d pay $367,083 in interest over the life of your loan \u2014 on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.49% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage .\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you\u2019ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that\u2019s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you\u2019re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.49% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,450 . But you\u2019d only pay $140,939 in interest over the years.\n\nDig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage , your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends \u2014 that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score , or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown (as mentioned early in the article) is also an option \u2014 for example, maybe you get a 6.5% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.5% for year one, increase to 5.5% for year two, then settle in at 6.5% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you\u2019ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.28%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.49%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.58%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.28%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly in 2025 while economists monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve. Still, rates have fallen recently with the next Fed meeting this week.\n\nThe amount of time it takes to refinance a house depends on your mortgage type, personal finances, and lender.

      "summary": "More drivers are rolling negative equity into new car loans. Here\u2019s how to minimize the cost as much as possible in this situation, experts say.",
      "text": "More drivers across the country are \"underwater\" or \"upside down\" on their auto loans \u2014 meaning they owe more money than the car is worth. That's costing them when it comes time to buy a new car.\n\nAbout 26.6% of trade-ins toward new car purchases had negative equity in the second quarter of 2025, according to Edmunds, an auto site. That figure is up slightly from 26.1% in the first quarter of the year, and the highest it's been in the last four years, said Ivan Drury, the director of insights at Edmunds.\n\nThe last time it was higher was in the first quarter of 2021, when 31.9% of new car trade-ins were underwater, according to the report.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Here's how to handle your student loans after losing a job $1.787 billion Powerball jackpot winning tickets sold in two states How to get the best mortgage rates as 30-year fixed nears a 1-year low\n\nSuch drivers are not underwater by insignificant amounts. The average amount owed on upside-down loans in the second quarter was $6,754, down slightly from the prior quarter's $6,880, Edmunds found.\n\n\"It's a staggering figure to look at,\" said Drury.\n\nDrivers trading in an upside-down car will need to come up with cash to pay that balance, or roll it into their new loan, experts say.\n\nTo be sure, it's not unusual to see underwater auto loans.\n\nYou may already be underwater on your loan from the moment you drive out of the dealer with the new vehicle, as cars are depreciating assets, said Brian Moody, senior staff writer at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book.\n\nBut other choices you make, such as taking on a longer loan term or making a smaller down payment, can exacerbate the issue.\n\nStill, lengthening an auto loan's terms is \"the one thing consumers can do to decrease costs,\" said Drury.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where 84-month auto loans have become \"increasingly common,\" he said. In the second quarter of 2025, 84-month auto loans comprised of 21.6% of new auto loans, up from 19.2% the quarter prior, according to Edmunds data provided to CNBC.\n\nTo compare, 72-month loans were at 36.1% in the second quarter, down from 38.6% in the same timeframe, according to the data.\n\nIt isn't a problem to have negative equity when you still own and drive the car, Moody said. It becomes an issue when you need to sell or trade it in.\n\nNegative equity can also be problematic if your vehicle is totaled. After an accident, your insurer will typically pay the actual cash value of the car. If that's less than what you owe on your loan, you're responsible for the remaining cost.\n\nKeep your current vehicle if you can, experts say, to avoid having to roll that debt into a new loan or come up with cash to cover it.\n\nIf you truly need a new car, it's important to do preliminary research before you even walk into a car dealership.\u00a0If you have negative equity from a prior auto loan, rolling it over to a lower-interest car loan can help you save on borrowing costs, Drury said.\n\nFirst, understand what your credit score is, said Moody. Generally speaking, the higher your score , the better the interest rate and loan terms lenders offer you.\n\n\"Knowing your credit score and knowing what interest rate you qualify for is important to know upfront,\" Moody said.\n\nTry to get pre-approved for different auto loans across several banks or lenders, said Drury. This helps you get a better gauge of the terms you can qualify for and distinguish the best offers.\n\nOnce you're ready to buy, the auto dealer might either try to match the deals you have or offer better financing options, he said.\n\nIf you're going to be underwater on that new loan \u2014 say, because you're rolling in debt from your prior vehicle or taking on a long loan term \u2014 ask your auto dealer or insurer about guaranteed asset protection insurance, also known as gap insurance, said Moody.\n\n\"Gap insurance covers the difference between what the vehicle is worth, and what is owed on it\" if your vehicle is in an accident, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group.\n\nIn most policies, adding gap insurance alongside collision and comprehensive coverage can cost an additional $20 per year to the annual premium, according to III.",

      "text": "China's economic slowdown deepened in August with a raft of key indicators missing expectations, as weak domestic demand persisted and Beijing's campaign against industrial overcapacity curbed output.\n\nRetail sales last month rose 3.4% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday, missing analysts' estimates for 3.9% growth in a Reuters poll and slowing from July's 3.7% growth.\n\nIndustrial output growth slowed to 5.2% in August, compared to the 5.7% jump in July, marking its weakest level since August 2024, according to LSEG data. Economists had expected the data to be unchanged from the previous month.\n\nFixed-asset investment, reported on a year-to-date basis, expanded just 0.5%, a sharp slowdown from the 1.6% expansion in the January to July period, and undershooting economists' forecasts for 1.4% growth.\n\nWithin that segment, the contraction in\u00a0real estate investment\u00a0worsened, slumping 12.9% in the first eight months, government data showed. Investment in the manufacturing and utilities sector \u2014 including electricity, fuel and water supplies \u2014 increased 5.1% and 18.8% from a year earlier, respectively.\n\nFixed-asset investments have been largely propped up by state-owned enterprises, with investments from the private sector contracting from a year earlier, said Yuhan Zhang, principal economist at think-tank The Conference Board's China Center.\n\nInvestments in manufacturing overall have seen \"modest and uneven growth,\" Zhang added, mainly supported by policy-driven state investment in infrastructure, high-tech and industrial upgrading, while real estate activity remains weak.\n\nChina's survey-based urban unemployment rate in August came in at 5.3%, edging higher from 5.2% in the prior month. The statistics bureau attributed the rise in the jobless rate to the graduation season.\n\n\"We should be aware that there are many unstable and uncertain factors in (the) external environment,\u00a0and national economic development is still confronted with multiple risks and challenges,\" the statistics bureau said in an English-language release.\n\n\"We must fully implement macro policies, focus on keeping employment, businesses, market\u2026expectations stable, deepen reform and opening up and innovation,\u00a0so as to foster steady and healthy economic development.\"\n\nRetail sales, excluding automobile consumption, grew 3.7% in August from a year earlier. Consumption growth in rural areas outpaced that in the urban centers, growing 4.6% in August from a year ago.\n\nThe NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said in a press conference following the release that it was hard to tell whether consumer inflation had reached an inflection point, while expecting consumer prices to remain volatile.\n\nChina's consumer price index fell more than expected last month , dipping 0.4% from a year earlier, while a deflation in producer prices persisted for a third year.\n\nFu acknowledged uncertainty around \"imported inflation\" \u2014 where prices of imported goods may increase for reasons such as a weakening yuan, rising global commodity prices, and higher tariff rates. He also pointed to support from \"anti-involution\" policies targeting excessive competition and price wars from manufacturers that would eventually spill over to consumer prices.\n\nAmong the categories that experienced the largest growth, sales of gold, silver and jewelry grew 16.8% in August from a year earlier, while that of sports and entertainment products rose 16.9%, and sales of furniture increased 18.6% from a year ago.\n\nThe biggest laggards in consumption were petroleum, as well as tobacco and alcohol related products.\n\nService consumption gained momentum, led by travel, leisure and transport, signaling a gradual shift in spending toward services, Zhang pointed out.\n\nThe slowdown in retail sales growth was mainly due to weaker demand for home appliances and electronics, as the boost from Beijing's consumer goods trade-in subsidies started to fade, Lisheng Wang, China economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note Monday.\n\nWang expected consumption growth to slow \"more meaningfully\" from September due to the \"unfavourable base effects,\" stressing that \"incremental and targeted easing\" is necessary in the coming quarters.\n\nThe mainland's CSI 300 index advanced nearly 1% after the release of China's economic data.\n\n\"The slowdown is not a surprise to the markets,\" as investors had already expected growth to weaken in the third quarter, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, after the boost from exports and Beijing's fiscal support had both faded.\n\nBeijing's fiscal policy may turn \"more supportive on the margin,\" but a large stimulus package is unlikely, unless Beijing sees the economy is in danger of missing its 5% growth target, Zhang added.",

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nGameStop Corp. ( GME ) reported strong free cash flow (FCF) results on Tuesday, Sept. 9, for its quarter ending Aug. 2. GME stock looks deeply undervalued as a result. Analysts still don't cover it, but my Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) assessment is over $31 per share.\n\nGME closed at $24.93 on Friday, Sept. 12, up from $22.94 before the results release, and up from a recent trough of $22.14 on June 12.\n\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nBut, based on its revenue and free cash flow (FCF) performance on Sept. 9 (as well as its strong balance sheet), GME stock could have considerable upside. This article will show why.\n\nGameStop reported that fiscal Q2 net revenue rose +21.78% Y/Y from $798.3 million last year to $972.2 million. This was even though GameStop now has significantly fewer stores open than a year ago.\n\nFor example, last quarter it sold all its stores in Canada, including its e-commerce business there. That represented 4.7% of its Q2 2024 sales. It is also set to divest its French stores.\n\nGameStop closed 590 stores in 2024, and it said in the latest 10-Q filing, \u201c we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025 .\u201d\n\nSo, to see sales rise over 21%, despite these closures, is impressive. It implies that the remaining stores, on a like-for-like basis, are doing exceedingly well. Curiously, the company does not report its \u201csame-store\u201d sales revenue, but just total revenue.\n\nThat might imply that investors can continue to anticipate revenue increases, as apparently, store sales and e-commerce are becoming more efficient at GameStop.\n\nThis is apparent, by the way, as Q2 sales exceeded analysts' expectations. Seeking Alpha reports that the revenue \u201cbeat\u201d was $148.96 million (i.e., analysts were only expecting $823.24 million). That implies a huge revenue surprise of +18%.\n\nHowever, only 1 or 2 analysts are covering GME stock, so it is not widely followed by Wall Street. This may begin to change if the company's revenue continues to gain momentum.\n\nOne area that stands out, for example, is that its sales mix now includes significantly higher \u201ccollectibles\u201d sales. This can be seen in the Schedule 1 table that GameStop provided.\n\nIt shows that collectibles, including Pok\u00e9mon trading cards, now account for over one-quarter of sales for the half-year results, up from 16.4% a year ago.\n\nThis type of net sales is much more profitable. GameStop does not break down its gross margin mix.\n\nHowever, management wrote on page 23 of the 10-Q that the higher hardware sales in Q2 2025 vs. last year led to a lower gross margin (29.1% this quarter vs. 31.2% last year). This was because new hardware sales have a lower gross margin than collectibles and pre-owned hardware and accessories.\n\nThe point is that as collectible sales grow strongly, its gross and operating margins will increase as well.\n\nDespite the strong contribution from its huge cash pile, the underlying business also had strong free cash flow (FCF) growth. I talked about this in my last Barchart article on GameStop on June 15 (\" GameStop Stock Is a Sum-of-the-Parts Bargain\u2026 \" ).\n\nFor example, on Sept. 9, GameStop reported that its operating cash flow (OCF) was $117.4 million. After deducting $4.1 million in capex, its FCF was $113.3 million , up from $65.5 million FCF a year ago (i.e., +73.8% Y/Y).\n\nNow, after deducting $79.6 million interest (from the income statement), its Q2 2025 FCF from operations was $33.7 million , vs. $26.0 million a year ago (i.e., $65.5m-$39.5m interest). This means its net operating FCF rose +29.6% Y/Y, not including the extra interest income from its huge cash pile.\n\nIn other words, despite fewer stores being open, GameStop is squeezing out more cash from its operations. For example, the net FCF margin from operations is now:\n\n$33.7m / $972.2m, or 3.47% , up from 3.26% a year ago (i.e., $26.0m/$798.3m)\n\nThe point is, even if sales fall due to fewer stores outstanding, we can project higher FCF from GameStop's operations, not including higher cash interest from its cash pile.\n\nFor example, the two analysts who cover GameStop are projecting 12% lower sales next year at just $3.61 billion, vs. $4.16 billion this year. (This is despite higher 1.45% sales so far this year in H1). That implies the next 12 months (NTM) net sales could average $3.885 billion.\n\nIf we apply a 3.47% operating FCF margin, it implies that FCF (before interest) will be $134.81 million . That is equal to 4 times its existing $33.7 million net FCF, despite lower sales being projected. (If the opposite occurs, i.e., sales rise, the FCF will be higher).\n\nThe bottom line is that GameStop's cash flow is set to be at least the same, if not higher, from its operations. That makes its stores worth considerably more, as can be seen in a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation.\n\nStores. I discussed a similar company's valuation, Chewy, Inc. (CHWY), based on its FCF margins and FCF forecasts (Sept. 12 Barchart article \" Chewy Stock Is Down After Strong FCF Results - CHWY Is Worth 15%+ More .\").\n\nChewy, Inc., recently made a 3.41% quarterly FCF margin, and over the trailing 12 months (TTM) period, its FCF margin was 3.75% I valued its business at a 2.89% FCF yield (i.e., 34.6x FCF multiple, the reciprocal of a FCF yield), based on its TTM FCF yield metric.\n\nSo, if we estimate that GameStop's stores will generate $135 million in FCF over the next 12 months, here is what the stores' revenue would be worth:\n\n$135m x 34.6 = $4,590 million, or $4.59 billion\n\nNote that this valuation is equal to 1.1x estimated sales this year ($4.16 billion). That seems a bit too low. A more reasonable valuation, given its strong FCF growth and cash accumulation debt-free (see below), is at least 2.0 times sales, or $8.320 billion:\n\nSince there are now 447.666484 million shares outstanding (according to the 10-Q as of Sept. 5), that means the stores are worth:\n\n$8,320m / 447.666484m = $18.59 per share\n\nNet Cash . As of Q2, GameStop had $8.6944 billion of cash on its balance sheet, equal to $19.42 per share. However, its net cash is lower, since there is $4.1609 billion in convertible debt on its balance sheet as well. (Note I don't count short-term liabilities and operating leases, as these would be included in any valuation of the stores).\n\n$8.6944b cash - $4.1609b debt = $4.5335 billion net cash\n\n$4,533.5m / 447.666484m shares O/S = $10.13 per share\n\nSo, just including the stores and net cash, the stock is worth $28.72 per share.\n\nThat leaves its Bitcoin holdings and the expected accumulation of net interest income (at no cost).\n\nBitcoin Assets . GameStop has not increased its stake in Bitcoin, still holding at 4,710 BTC (^BTCUSD). As of today, they are worth $115,702.89 per BTC:\n\n$115,702.89 x 4,710 = $544.96 million, or $1.217 per share\n\nThat is up 8.99% from a $500 million cost, but this gain is automatically included in the SOTP analysis.\n\nSo, before including any value accruing to GameStop from expected interest income, the SOTP value of GME stock is $21.597 or $29.94 per share.\n\nInterest Accumulation. GameStop is making about 4% annually on its interest income. For example, last quarter, its interest income was between $80 million and $95.0 million on between $8.694 billion and $8.565.8 billion (the latter not including FCF contributions). That works out to about 1.0% during the quarter on the $8.6944 billion figure, or 4.0% annualized.\n\nNote, I calculated the $95 million in interest this way: $6.3858 billion in Q1 cash May 3, plus $2.68 billion (from selling an upsized amount of senior convertible notes due 2032) received on June 17. That equals $9.0658 billion, less $500 million paid for BTC assets, or a net cash amount of $8.5658 billion. Therefore, the net cash accumulated during the quarter was:\n\n$8.6944 billion - $8.5658 billion as of June 17 = +$128.6 million Q2 cash growth\n\nI estimate that, after deducting $33.7 million in FCF (see above), the interest income accumulation for the quarter was about $94.9 million. However, that was higher than the $79.6 million in interest income from the income statement, and the difference could be due to net changes in working capital or costs from the convertible sales.\n\nSo, for example, if the company averaged about $8.65 billion in net cash during the quarter and its interest income was $85 million, its net interest rate was about 1.0%.\n\nWe can use that to estimate its next 12 months (NTM) interest accumulation. For example, on a balance of $8.7 billion in cash, 4.0% equals $348 million. But also, the operations are generating about $135 million in FCF. So, the total accumulation of cash will be $483 million over the next 12 months:\n\n$483m/$447.666484 million shares = $1.08 per share\n\nThat means the total SOTP value is $31.02 per share.\n\nThat is +24.4% more than GME's present stock price. The bottom line is that GME stock looks undervalued here. As its FCF continues to grow, the market may end up valuing it higher.\n\nOne way to play this is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in near-term expiry periods. That way, an investor can make extra income while waiting for the stock to fall.\n\nFor example, the $23.00 put option contract expiring Oct. 10 has a midpoint premium of $0.44. That means an investor who enters an order to \u201cSell to Open\u201d this contract can make an immediate yield of 1.91% over the next 27 days to expiry (DTE).\n\nThe investor must first secure $2,300 in cash or buying power with their brokerage firm to act as collateral to buy 100 shares at $23.00. That then leads to an immediate income of $44.00 in the account.\n\nAs a result, the net breakeven point is $23.00 - $0.44, or $22.56. That is 9.5% below Friday's close, and provides an attractive potential entry buy-in price for an investor.\n\nFor example, if GME eventually reaches $31.00, the upside potential is +37.4 % (i.e., $31.00/$22.56 -1). Moreover, if an investor can repeat this 1.91% short-put yield over the next 3 months, the expected return (ER) would be 5.73%, an annualized +22.92% .\n\nThe bottom line here is that GME stock is undervalued on an SOTP basis, and shorting OTM puts is one attractive way to play this.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "text": "In this article\n\nThe latest earnings season has addressed investors' concerns about the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to the robust growth outlook and capital spending projections of many tech companies.\n\nInvestors seeking exposure to companies that are well-positioned to capture AI-led growth can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who can help pick the stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term.\n\nHere are three stocks favored by\u00a0the Street's top pros, according to\u00a0TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on past performance.\n\nSemiconductor company Broadcom ( AVGO ) reported impressive fiscal third-quarter results and issued solid guidance , thanks to AI tailwinds. AVGO stock rallied following the results, as the company stated that it has secured a new $10 billion customer.\n\nCiting strong fundamentals, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on Broadcom stock and boosted the price target to $400 from $325, saying that AVGO remains a top pick in semiconductors. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $396.\n\nSur attributed Broadcom's strong results and solid revenue outlook for the October quarter to accelerating AI demand, stabilizing non-AI semiconductors, and impressive momentum in the VMware business.\n\nThe 5-star analyst noted the 18% sequential growth in AVGO's Q3 FY25 AI revenue, with the company guiding a 19% quarter-over-quarter growth to $6.2 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. He added that Broadcom is on track to deliver about $20 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2025.\n\nSur believes that the new customer from whom Broadcom secured orders worth $10 billion is OpenAI, considering the AI inference use case and his prior research. The analyst now expects AI revenue to increase by 125% to $45 billion in fiscal 2026, followed by a 60% increase in fiscal 2027. Sur said the strength in AVGO's AI revenue supports his view that the company's internally developed custom AI chips offer meaningful differentiation, efficiency and improved economics.\n\n\"Despite macro volatility, Broadcom's diversified portfolio and product cycles support a solid revenue growth profile,\" concluded Sur.\n\nSur ranks No. 39 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See\u00a0Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks.\n\nNext on this week's list is Zscaler ( ZS ), a cybersecurity company that recently delivered strong results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions.\n\nImpressed by the Q4 FY25 print, Stifel analyst Adam Borg reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock and raised the price forecast to $330 from $295. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" stock on ZS stock with a price target of $298.\n\nBorg stated that Zscaler delivered solid results, consistent with Stifel's positive checks. He added that the company's Q4 FY25 performance was strong across key metrics, driven by strong execution and demand for the company's broadening Zero-Trust portfolio. Borg was particularly pleased with robust growth in billings and remaining performance obligations. Notably, RPO growth (31%) accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\nThe 5-star analyst is optimistic about the adoption of Zscaler's offerings across emerging areas, like AI security. Borg is also upbeat about the company's newer solutions like Z-Flex. He continues to believe that \"Zscaler's leading-portfolio helps improve an organization's security posture, drives vendor consolidation, and reduces costs.\"\n\nBord expects Zscaler to sustain at least high-teens top-line growth and margin expansion in the coming years, driven by multiple drivers.\n\nBorg ranks No. 324 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 77% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.9%. See\u00a0Zscaler Ownership Structure on TipRanks.\n\nDatabase software maker and cloud infrastructure company Oracle ( ORCL ) saw its stock spike this week, as the company's robust cloud growth projections overshadowed its Q1 earnings miss. The company surprised the market by reporting a 359% year-over-year growth in its remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue, to $455 billion.\n\nOracle's robust outlook made Jefferies analyst Brent Thill increase his price target to $360 from $270 while reiterating a buy rating on the stock. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on ORCL stock with a price target of $264.\n\n\"RPO stole the show in F1Q,\" stated Thill. The 5-star analyst added that Oracle's Q1 RPO crushed estimates and reinforced his confidence in the company's narrative about acceleration in its growth.\n\nThill highlighted that Oracle added $317 billion sequentially in RPO, nearly five times the fiscal 2026 total revenue estimate of $67 billion, which supports growing AI optimism. He noted that this massive growth can be mainly attributed to four multi-billion-dollar contracts across three customers, with more such deals expected to close soon and drive RPO beyond $500 billion.\n\nThe analyst also pointed out that the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business is expected to grow by 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 and then jump to $144 billion by fiscal 2030. Thill added that this impressive growth forecast indicates the rising demand for AI inference and training workloads, which management sees as a massive total addressable market that the company can capture.\n\nAdditionally, Thill mentioned the impressive surge in Oracle's multicloud database revenue, though off smaller numbers, suggesting rapid adoption of the company's multicloud strategy. In fact, Oracle now expects notable growth in multicloud revenue every quarter for the next several years while expanding to 71 (net addition of 37) data centers across hyperscaler peers.\n\nThill ranks No. 128 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.9%. See\u00a0Oracle Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.",

      "summary": "The return-to-office orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety.",
      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nA lot can change over the course of five years \u2014 especially if they happen to follow a norm-shattering, once-in-several-generations pandemic.\n\nIn the white-collar workplace, the pandemic meant a sudden shift to remote work. And just as the world started to return to normal with the arrival of COVID vaccines, companies and their employees entered a cold war over return-to-office mandates.\n\nNow, five years out, the work-from-where debate is reaching a fever pitch. Earlier this year, corporate giants such as Amazon and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 as well as much of the US federal government \u2014 ordered employees to return to the office a full five days a week. More recently, Paramount and Novo Nordisk have declared an end to remote work, while Microsoft and NBCUniversal beefed up their hybrid work requirements.\n\nThe return-to-office (RTO) orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety. Meanwhile, the corporate world\u2019s multi-year work-from-home (WFH) experiment has left the relative merits of remote work solely in the eye of the beholder (though it\u2019s seldom difficult to guess which people on your company\u2019s org chart hold which opinions). Basically, depending on whom you ask, remote work has officially become the cause of \u2014 or solution to \u2014 all of the corporate world\u2019s problems.\n\nREAD ALSO: Can a Fed Rate Cut Boost the Magnificent Seven to New Heights? and Caught Between Painful Present and Optimistic Outlook: Copper\u2019s Tariff Price Odyssey\n\nDespite the raft of high-profile return-to-office orders this year, the actual WFH rate has remained roughly stable since 2023, experts told The Daily Upside. About 62% of salaried employees worked from an office full-time in August, according to data from university researchers Nicholas Bloom, Jose Maria Barrero and Steven J. Davis \u2014\u00a0roughly flat since RTO orders came back in full swing in 2023, though way below pre-pandemic norms. About 25% of full work days have been WFH since 2023, the researchers have also found.\n\n\u201cThere does appear to be a slight uptick in RTO activity\u201d this summer, Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University who has studied WFH trends since 2004, told The Daily Upside. The Placer.ai Nationwide Office Building Index, which tracks foot traffic data from about 1,000 top-tier office buildings across the country, showed foot traffic was up about 10% year-over-year in July, and another 2.9% in August \u2014 though it still remains about 30% below the 2019 level.\n\nOne reason the overall figures may still look flat, despite major new RTO orders? \u201cBig shrinking firms are tending to RTO, while younger growing firms tend to be more WFH. This generates offsetting impacts, and it\u2019s very possible the net impact is zero,\u201d Bloom said.\n\nMeanwhile, Indeed Hiring Lab\u2019s Remote Tracker , which tracks the percentage of job postings on Indeed that mention hybrid or remote work, similarly shows that such postings are roughly flat, if not slightly down, since 2023, and are below a 2022 peak.\n\nFor the commercial real estate industry \u2014 which feared the pandemic and WFH trends could trigger so-called \u201curban doom loops\u201d \u2014 the RTO trend has been life-renewing.\n\nMonthly office visits in New York City inched above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in July, according to Placer.AI data. Miami is just 0.1% below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the AI boom has led to a near-miraculous downtown recovery in the tech hub of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of false starts [since the end of the pandemic], but there\u2019s a huge push right now to return to office,\u201d Jeff Ingham, commercial real estate advisor at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), told The Daily Upside. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as it was. It\u2019s actually real this time.\u201d\n\nThe Sunk-Cost-Fallacy Fallacy: That push has coincided with a \u201cflight to quality,\u201d Ingham says, with companies increasingly chasing office space in so-called Class A buildings that come packed with everything from high-end gyms to dog-friendly areas, and even golf simulators. The message to employees: Come back to the office; it won\u2019t be that bad!\n\n\u201cAll of our clients think that the office market\u2019s depressed, but the reality is the buildings they want to be in are actually more expensive than they were in 2019,\u201d Ingham said.\n\nIn other words, your corporate overlords aren\u2019t simply (or, at least, always) falling victim to the sunk-cost fallacy of ordering a return to office because they\u2019re already locked in to expensive leases. They\u2019re signing up for even more expensive leases to get employees back in the office.\n\nBlowing in the Wind: The recovery is not equal, however. Lower-tier Class B and Class C buildings are increasingly getting the brush-off, and Ingham says, are being converted to non-office use,\u00a0be it industrial or residential.\n\nNot every city has bounced back in the same way, either. Chicago \u201cis a tough one,\u201d Ingham said, because the city has less need to convert office space into residential buildings and has struggled to return office work to near pre-pandemic levels. Office foot traffic is down around 34% compared with pre-pandemic levels in the Windy City, according to Placer.AI data.\n\nStill, overall across the US, \u201cthere\u2019s a shift,\u201d Ingham said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be monumental, but it totally is going to stabilize the office market compared to where it was, which was kind of free fall.\u201d\n\nSo if it\u2019s not (always) a case of sunk-cost fallacy, then what is it? The answer, in many cases, may be cost control . Indeed, given that employees tend to favor the flexibility of WFH, employers have begun using RTO orders to cull headcount after pandemic-era overhiring.\n\n\u201cContacts in multiple districts reported reducing headcounts through attrition \u2014 encouraged, at times, by return-to-office policies,\u201d the Federal Reserve wrote in its August Beige Book report .\n\n\u201cFrom talking to hundreds of firms and executives, this is widely acknowledged as one reason for RTOs,\u201d Bloom told The Daily Upside. \u201cIt is very similar to policies that eliminate free food, reduce health-care coverage or cut pension contributions. They make it less pleasant to work at the firm and will increase attrition.\u201d\n\nBloom said attrition via RTO mandates is concentrated among larger firms that are typically stalling on growth, and full-time mandates are likely to reduce headcounts by as much as 10%.\n\n\u201cExecutives do not want to talk about this,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cThe reason is this is damaging for share prices. Firms known to be focusing on reducing headcount via RTO are clearly on a less promising path.\u201d While the motivation is a cheap way to reduce headcount (freely departing workers are often not entitled to severance pay), \u201cthe obvious [downside] is you don\u2019t choose who leaves.\u201d\n\nAmazon, for instance, has seen top-flight AI talent flee amid its strict RTO mandates, according to a recent Business Insider feature . The more WFH-positive Oracle has poached as many as 600 Amazon employees in the past two years, according to a Bloomberg report .\n\nMasculine Energy: Still, shedding employees isn\u2019t the only reason companies are embracing RTO orders. At the end of the day, productivity equates to profit \u2014 and some leaders still believe that in-person work culture is the spark that drives growth.\n\nWho, exactly, believes that is somewhat predictable, however.\n\n\u201cWe found return-to-office mandates are more likely in firms with male and powerful CEOs,\u201d Mark Ma, an associate business professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the topic, recently told CNBC . \u201cThey are used to working in the office for five days a week. And they feel that they are losing control over their employees who are working from home.\u201d\n\nThe profile of employees who leave companies following RTO mandates is predictable as well. A 2024 research report from Ma and associates found that turnover rates following RTO orders are \u201cmore pronounced for female employees, more senior employees, and more skilled employees.\u201d That\u2019s similar to findings in a study by Bloom and associates published in Nature last year, which also found that companies with hybrid work structures reduced employee quit rates by one-third compared with full-time in-office companies, saving millions of dollars in recruiting, hiring and training costs.\n\nThe RTO turnover trend is taking its toll on equitable pay. Data released last week from the US Census Bureau showed that the gender wage gap increased for the second straight year in 2024, returning to 2017 levels.\n\nThe RTO push \u201cis a big part of that,\u201d Indeed Hiring Lab economist Allison Shrivastava told The Daily Upside. \u201cRemote work for mothers, in particular, is pretty important.\u201d\n\nIt could spell trouble for the US economy down the line, Shrivastava said.\n\n\u201cWe may have a soft labor market, but long-term, we do also have a declining labor force participation rate. We\u2019re going to need more people to work. Increasing the female labor force participation rate is going to be important, and increasing flexibility is going to be important across the board for a lot of these jobs.\u201d\n\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "summary": "Should you buy a Florida vacation home before retirement if you haven\u2019t paid off your primary mortgage?",
      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSeven years from retirement, Ellen and Charlie face a tempting choice: buy a Florida vacation home now, or wait until their finances are more secure.\n\nOn the surface, the idea seems idyllic. The couple, both in their late 50s, dream of escaping harsh winters and creating a legacy property they can one day pass on to their only daughter. But the timing is complicated. Their primary mortgage still has $120,000 outstanding, and while they\u2019ve saved $400,000 toward retirement, their nest egg will need to stretch across decades.\n\nTheir dream is emotionally charged. The couple picture family holidays under the palm trees, and their daughter inheriting not just a home but cherished memories. Yet lurking beneath is the fear of regret: what if this vacation property undermines the retirement security they\u2019ve worked so hard to build?\n\nThis is a common crossroads for pre-retirees. According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, 39% of working-age households today won't be able to maintain their current living standard during retirement [1]. That potentially makes a vacation home not just an escape, but another financial obligation.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBuying a second property before retirement has a clear emotional appeal, but it also creates significant financial risk for the couple, as they are considering a second mortgage before their first is paid.\n\nEven if Ellen and Charlie rent their Florida home part-time, that rental income isn't guaranteed to offset the costs. Local rules on short-term rentals could change, or demand could drop. Florida has seen municipalities increasingly crack down on short-term rentals with stricter regulations, higher taxes, fines and permit requirements [2].\n\nAnother risk is assuming the housing market will strengthen. Currently, Florida buyers have leverage and market cycles are unpredictable. If prices soften just as the couple retires, they could find themselves holding an asset worth less than what they paid \u2014 an especially painful outcome if they\u2019re forced to sell during a downturn.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nWith $400,000 saved, Ellen and Charlie have a healthy start, but experts often recommend that retirees have at least 10 times their income saved to comfortably cover expenses throughout retirement.\n\nFor a household earning $90,000 annually, that could mean closer to $1 million by retirement age. Adding the burden of a second mortgage may make it harder to reach that target.\n\nMoreover, a 2024 study from Northwestern Mutual shows that Americans believe they will need a total of $1.46 million to retire comfortably [3]. Ellen and Charlie are far short of that goal.\n\nBuying a second home also means diverting money away from safer, more flexible investments. If unexpected health issues or job loss arise before retirement, a vacation home would tie up funds in an illiquid asset.\n\nSelling quickly could force the couple to accept a loss. If, say, they purchased a $350,000 property and had to sell during a downturn with values falling 10 to 15%, they could be out $35,000 to $50,000, not counting transaction costs.\n\nA big factor that could affect the couple's Florida home purchase is whether they rent it out before retirement. Many buyers assume that owning a vacation property means they can easily list it on Airbnb or Vrbo to offset mortgage costs. In Florida, however, short-term rental rules can vary drastically by jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, cities such as Miami Beach have cracked down on vacation rentals, with steep fines for operating without the proper license [4]. Other municipalities allow rentals but impose restrictions such as minimum-night stays, special permits or occupancy limits. Even HOAs often have their own rules, and many explicitly prohibit rentals under 30 days.\n\nOn top of that, the couple would need to register with the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation if they plan to rent the property for less than 30 days more than three times per year. Local jurisdictions may also require additional tourist development tax collection [5].\n\nIgnoring these rules could not only cost them thousands in fines but also make it impossible to reliably rent the property when they need extra income.\n\nThe couple also needs to weigh other Florida costs. Homeowners\u2019 insurance in the state has skyrocketed, driven by hurricane risks and insurer withdrawals from the market. As of 2023, the average annual premium was more than $6,000, nearly four times the U.S. average [6].\n\nMortgage rates, currently hovering above 6.6% for a 30-year fixed loan, would add further strain.\n\nWeather risks are another factor. Rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes mean the property may require costly maintenance, stormproofing or even long-term value erosion. What feels like a dream investment could become a liability if climate challenges intensify.\n\nIn all, Ellen and Charlie should reevaluate their plan with realistic numbers in mind for the costs and their budget. They may consider a vacation home in another area of the country with less risk associated, or they may realize that they need to focus on building their retirement savings \u2014 and opt to make memories at a rented property instead.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWhy bother with a mortgage when you have billions of dollars? Why even fill out a loan application for that matter when you could simply pay cash for any home on the market?\n\nWell, property records examined by The Daily Mail suggest that Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 took on not one, but two mortgages on their $88 million Bel-Air mansion.\n\nThe couple is worth roughly $3.3 billion together and secured a $57.75 million mortgage on the property this April. That\u2019s in addition to the previous $52.8 million mortgage secured four years ago.\n\nAre the music moguls now just broke billionaires, as some online commentators have speculated, or is this a savvy real estate move? Here\u2019s a closer look.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nAn outstanding liability of roughly $110.55 million on a single property likely sounds mind-boggling, though that figure is just 3.4% of the couple\u2019s combined wealth.\n\nAnd they have secured fairly attractive interest rates on both mortgages. According to The Daily Mail , the new mortgage from Morgan Stanley\u2019s Private Bank Group had a 30-year term with an interest rate fixed at 5% for the next 10 years. The previous mortgage, meanwhile, was secured from Goldman Sachs at 3.15%. Effectively, the average rate on both mortgages is significantly below the August 2025 30-year mortgage rate of 6.6%, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven if the interest rates were closer to the average, these loans would have still unlocked some key financial benefits for the billionaire couple.\n\nBy borrowing money against an asset they can easily afford, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 seem to be pulling from the \u201cBuy, Borrow, Die\u201d playbook. The strategy involves acquiring appreciating assets, such as real estate, stocks or artwork. Then they borrow against those assets to create tax-free cash flow, subsequently passing the assets to their heirs (Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir) to erase capital gains over the long term.\n\nBeyond the tax advantages, this method also helps wealthy families minimize opportunity costs. By borrowing against their Bel-Air mansion, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 can invest roughly $110 million in their various business ventures or even the S&P 500, which has delivered a compounded annual growth rate of 13.66% over the past ten years.\n\nOn their passing, the property portfolio\u2019s tax basis would reset, potentially saving the three children millions of dollars in capital gains taxes. And you don\u2019t have to be a billionaire to use leverage as a financial tool.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nAnyone, regardless of their net worth, can use debt in strategic ways to start building wealth.\n\nThe most important part of this strategy is to only borrow for appreciating assets. So, buying property with a mortgage or getting a business loan to start a new venture may help you build equity, while using an expensive personal loan or credit card debt to finance a vacation could destroy wealth over time.\n\nIf you\u2019re borrowing money, shop around for the best rate and try to negotiate before signing up. Every basis point you can cut from the loan agreement can magnify your savings over the long term.\n\nMortgage Research Center (MRC) can help you quickly compare rates and estimated monthly payments from multiple vetted lenders at once. All you have to do is enter some basic information about yourself, such as your zip code, your desired property type, price range and annual income.\n\nBased on the information you provide, MRC will show you mortgage offers tailored to your needs so you can shop for a mortgage with confidence.\n\nAfter you match with a desired lender, you can set up a free, no-obligation consultation to see if you\u2019ve found the right fit.\n\nYou may also want a hard cap on how much you can borrow, regardless of how low the interest rate is or how attractive the underlying asset seems. Zuckerberg, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 have mortgages that are a small fraction of their net worth. Similarly, financial advisors suggest keeping your debt-to-income ratio below 41% to avoid risk.\n\nJay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Bel-Air estate is the crown jewel in a reportedly $313-million real estate portfolio that features a palatial Hamptons home, a sprawling Malibu mansion and a chic New York Penthouse. Real estate is not their only interest. A museum-worthy art collection, stakes in luxury brands like D'USS\u00c9 and Armand de Brignac, and a hit-studded music catalog all contribute to the power couple\u2019s $3 billion net worth.\n\nIf, like Jay and Bey, you have a portfolio with a wide range of assets, ranging from stocks and bonds to tangible assets like real estate or classic cars, you need a streamlined way to keep track of your net worth \u2014 because the more insight you have, the more you can focus on growing your wealth.\n\nWith Kubera, high-net-worth individuals can get a comprehensive view of their net worth in real-time .\n\nUnlike other wealth-tracking platforms, Kubera\u2019s unified dashboard encompasses everything from real estate to shares in holding companies, crypto wallets, and private equity. With Kubera\u2019s \u201cYour Club\u201d feature, you can also see how your portfolio stacks up compared to your peers in net worth.\n\nThe platform offers a unified dashboard that can connect thousands of banks, brokerages and crypto exchanges across multiple currencies, providing a complete picture of your financial position.

And since these retailers provide necessities, they tend to still perform well during times of economic volatility and can act as a hedge against inflation.\n\nYou can engage with experts, explore available deals and easily make an allocation, all in FNRP\u2019s personalized portal.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nYields on the $7 trillion parked in money market funds may soon be coming down.\n\nMarket participants anticipate the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate, and that could happen as quickly as the Sept. 16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. It may be hard to budge clients from their cash hoard since inertia has worked in their favor, but advisors are certainly rethinking their strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great period of performance for those investors. So it\u2019s hard to point fingers and say you\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d said Rebecca Venter, senior fixed-income product manager at Vanguard.\n\nBut reinvestment risk is building, she said, noting that fixed-income markets are pricing in a Federal Funds rate that\u2019s a full percentage point lower than the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The current effective Fed Funds rate is 4.33%. When the cuts begin, \u201cit will flow through into these short-term rates very quickly,\u201d she said. As such, some advisors are talking to clients about their next steps.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019re discussing with clients,\u201d said Jason Fannon, senior partner at Cornerstone Financial Services, who added that he is looking at a range of fixed income options, from certificates of deposit to corporate bonds.\n\nREAD ALSO: Can AI Lead Generation Ignite Organic Growth for Advisors? and Global Family Offices Unfettered by Military Conflicts, Recession Fears\n\nIt\u2019s a good time to lock in yields, Venter said. Even if an advisor bought an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, yields are historically high. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a yield in the 70 th percentile. So yields have only been higher 30% of the time than now. This is a really attractive yield, close to 4.5% overall for very high-quality fixed income,\u201d she said.\n\nFannon said he\u2019s waiting for the first Fed rate cut to be on the books before implementing any new positions, pointing out that markets had anticipated rate cuts earlier this year that never materialized. For his most conservative clients, he\u2019s building CD ladders, usually a one-to-five-year ladder or out to seven years. He may also look at fixed annuities but is sticking with double- or triple-A-rated insurance companies.\n\nAlso wary of duration and credit risks, he\u2019s staying in the short and intermediate parts of the yield curve and sticking to high quality. Fannon is using ETFs including Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Index ETF (VGSH) and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury Index ETF (VGIT) for liquidity and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF (VCSH) and Vanguard Intermediate Corporate Bond Index ETF (VCIT) for corporate bonds.\n\nMaggie Kulyk, CEO at Chicory Wealth, works with socially conscious investors, and is looking beyond US Treasurys for bond exposure. \u201cWe cater to an extremely politically progressive crowd. They\u2019ve been looking for alternatives to Treasurys, not just because of interest rates, but because of their, for lack of a better term, mistrust of this government,\u201d they said.\n\nOne of those alternatives is community development financial institutions, where they recently bought two-year notes yielding 4.5%, which they said \u201ccould look really good by the time we get to the end of 2027.\u201d They are also buying high-quality municipal bonds for clients in the highest tax brackets, where tax-free yields are above 7%. One fund they are using is MFS Municipal Income Fund (MFIAX).\n\nSteve Conners, founder and president of Conners Wealth Management, prefers to put cash to work in undervalued stock sectors for clients who have a longer-term horizon, especially if they are younger. He\u2019s looking at defensive sectors, dividend payers and small caps for value plays.\n\nFor his conservative clients, Conners likes telecommunications companies such as AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) for their price appreciation and dividends, with Verizon having a yield of over 6%. He also likes electric utilities, specifically, Sempra Energy (SRE), Duke Energy (DUK), American Electric Power (AEP) or Southern Company (SO) for their yields that come in around 3.3% and their wide moats. \u201cElectric utilities are defensive in nature, but they\u2019re doing well in this environment. AI (artificial intelligence) demand is only going to increase the need for electricity,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s also looking at small-cap stocks, noting the Russell 2000 index remains widely undervalued versus large caps. \u201cIf the Fed is going to be cutting rates, small caps should do well. The Russell 2000 has been performing well of late,\u201d he said.\n\nAlternate Universe. With valuations in parts of the public markets lofty, some advisors are looking to alternatives for income. John Rasic, financial advisor at Signature Estate and Investment Advisors, said he is looking at a few alternative investments. For fixed-income exposure, he is looking at private credit, such as higher quality middle-market lending funds, which offer yields of about 8.5% to 9% without taking on much credit risk.\n\nAnother option for income-seeking investors is master limited partnerships, which are at play between 6% to 8% dividend, he said. Infrastructure is also a new addition for Rasic, and it is appropriate for taxable accounts because of the return of capital aspect on the distribution. \u201cYou\u2019re getting close to maybe 10% but for 10 years, essentially that distribution returns capital,\u201d he said.\n\nKulyk is also seeking to diversify away from public markets when appropriate and is seeking out impact-focused direct investments. The platform Citizen Mint brings impact deals with initial investment levels of $50,000 to $100,000, versus the usual minimum investment of $250,000 and above for these types of deals, they said.\n\nFor example, last year they invested in a four-year financing deal for solar arrays to connect to the electric grid. The target net internal rate of return is 15.5%, with target annual cash distribution of 6.5%. While some of the deals require investors to be qualified or accredited, these deals are \u201ca great diversifier away from the volatility of public markets, but also deliver nice income,\u201d Kulyk said.\n\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to the report, the three most expensive states for homeowners insurance are:\n\nNebraska: $7,920\n\nOklahoma: $7,426\n\nKansas: $5,303\n\nThe three least expensive states for homeowners' insurance are:\n\nHawaii: $721\n\nVermont: $1,159\n\nDelaware: $1,225\n\nThe rising cost of homeowners' insurance is another financial burden on American consumers. So what\u2019s behind the rise?\n\nThe steady climb in homeowners' insurance isn\u2019t just about inflation. According to an analysis by the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I) [2], replacement costs for home repairs jumped more than 55% between 2020 and 2022. This was primarily attributed to higher prices for building materials, costs that may be passed directly onto policyholders.\n\nSevere weather events are occurring more often and causing greater damage. Insurers must not only pay out more claims but also buy more reinsurance (essentially insurance for insurance companies) and build up capital reserves to protect against catastrophic losses, reports the Brookings Institution [3]. That makes their business more expensive, which in turn can make your policy more expensive.\n\nInsurers have also begun to use more advanced risk modeling techniques, per Brookings. Instead of spreading costs evenly across broad regions, these models may be able to pinpoint which homes are considered high-risk and result in customized pricing.\n\nIn some areas, private insurance companies have stopped writing policies and even dropped existing ones, citing an increased cost of doing business. This has driven many homeowners toward \u201clast resort\u201d state-backed plans, which often provide more limited coverage at a higher cost.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nWhile you can't stop a tornado or move your property to a safer location, you can take steps to keep your homeowners' insurance rates in check. Here are a few strategies to save money.\n\nRates can vary drastically between insurance providers. Get quotes from several companies to make sure you're not overpaying. Independent insurance agents may be able to help you find a cheaper policy than you can find on your own.\n\nSome carriers offer discounts for things like paying bundling it with your car insurance or having a claim-free history. Call to ask about the discounts you might be eligible for.\n\nSome providers offer a discount if you reduce your risk by installing storm shutters, reinforcing your roof, adding fire-resistant siding or installing a home security system. Some states even mandate discounts for eligible safety upgrades, so research the laws in your area.\n\nIf you can afford it, consider a request to raise your deductible or the amount you must pay before insurance kicks in. Doing so can lower your premium \u2014 just make sure you\u2019re able to pay more for repairs when problems crop up.\n\nIn many cases, insurers factor credit into home insurance pricing.

      "text": "Something went wrong\n\nA shocking 46% of Gen Z has withdrawn funds from their retirement accounts, according to a recent study from Payroll Integrations [1]. While 42% of Gen Z withdrawals went toward paying off debt, that doesn\u2019t help them rebuild their retirement nest egg.\n\nGen Z employees are the most likely to pull from retirement savings, but they\u2019re not alone. About one in three workers across generations plan to tap their retirement funds in the next year, most often to cover emergencies or everyday expenses.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nWith the average personal savings rate hovering around 4%, a historically low rate, it\u2019s no surprise that many Americans are feeling squeezed.\n\nAn Empower survey found 37% of Americans couldn\u2019t afford an emergency expense over $400 [2]. About 25% said they\u2019d use a credit card to cover a $1,000 emergency [3].\n\nAll of these numbers point to a fragile financial reality for Americans. Some workers watch their retirement savings grow and can\u2019t help but think how useful that money would be right now. But dipping into those accounts early comes with long-term consequences.\n\nPulling money from your retirement account may solve an immediate cash crunch, but it sets you up for a smaller nest egg later in life.\n\nEarly withdrawals often come with penalties and taxes. For example, if you take money from a 401(k) before 59 1/2, you\u2019ll usually face a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of regular income taxes [4].\n\nThe real hit, though, comes from lost growth. Say you withdraw $10,000 from your 401(k) at age 25 to pay off debt. With a 7% annual return, that money could have grown to about $150,000 by age 65. You\u2019ll likely miss it in retirement [5].\n\nLess money in your account could force you to work longer or lower your standard of living later on. And many Americans already face that possibility. A study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that 39% of working-age households won\u2019t be able to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement [6].\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nUsing retirement funds to pay off debt might feel like a smart move, after all, you\u2019re cutting down bills now. But in reality, you\u2019re trading today\u2019s problem for tomorrow\u2019s, with less saved when you\u2019ll need it most.\n\nThere are very few situations where pulling money early makes sense. Extreme safety concerns, such as escaping domestic violence, might be one [7].\n\nIf you are considering taking money out of your 401(k) or other retirement account, talk to a financial advisor. They can help you map out a plan that doesn\u2019t involve raiding your retirement savings. If debt is your main issue, a financial planner can often design a payoff strategy that keeps your retirement intact.\n\nFor some, the answer is to tighten your spending. Cut back on non-essentials like eating out or impulse buys. Go through your spending with a fine-tooth comb \u2014 you might be surprised at what you can trim and redirect toward debt payments.\n\nFor others, earning more might be the better solution. Ask for a raise, look for a higher-paying job, pick up extra hours or even start a side hustle. About 45% of Americans have a side hustle, according to a recent survey, earning an average of $688 a month [8]. That extra cash could make a real difference in paying down debt and building savings.\n\nOnce you get your finances under control, prioritize building an emergency fund with three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses. That cushion gives you a safety net, so the next time life throws you an unexpected bill, you won\u2019t have to raid your retirement savings.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nBroadcom and Oracle continue to outperform the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d making the \u201cTen Titans\u201d a better representation of market leaders.\n\nHyperscalers are turning to Broadcom for its AI chips and infrastructure, and Oracle for its cloud infrastructure and enterprise software.\n\nThe Ten Titans' impact on the S&P 500 is impossible to ignore.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom \u203a\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) just delivered exceptional earnings reports and guidance that sent both tech stocks to all-time highs. Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock ( Microsoft , Apple , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Tesla ) except one -- Nvidia .\n\nThe \"Ten Titans\" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple , and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) . In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBeyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHere's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.\n\nBroadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.\n\nBroadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.\n\nCloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.\n\nBroadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.\n\nOracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.\n\nOracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the \"big three\" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.\n\nBroadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.\n\nThe breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n\nIn addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.\n\nIt's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $640,916 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,012 !*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,052 % \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 188% for the S&P 500.

He\u2019s looking to buy around $10,000 worth of high-end camera gear, including a new body and lens, and the seller is offering 12-month financing at 0% interest.

Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThe use of zero-interest financing is on the rise, with nearly half (48%) of Americans stating that a 0% annual percentage rate (APR) option would influence their purchase decisions [1]. Before you use this option, there are a few things you need to know.\n\nIf you have the money to pay off a purchase in full, there may be no harm in using zero-interest financing or buy now, pay later (BNPL). But this financing isn't without its drawbacks. Here are two potential pitfalls you need to know.\n\nThat 0% financing likely only stays in effect if you pay on time, every time. Missing just one payment can trigger retroactive financing, meaning you\u2019ll be charged interest on the entire purchase, not just on what you have left on the balance. And the interest rates are often extraordinarily high \u2014 more than 35% in some cases.\n\nResearch from the Harvard Business Review found that BNPL financing leads people to spend more than they intended [2]. Retailers aren't offering this out of the goodness of their hearts \u2014 they anticipate that consumers will spend more. And the financing company is betting that enough consumers will miss a payment to make it worthwhile.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nBefore you click \"agree\" on a 0% financing plan, take a step back and run through a quick checklist:\n\nDid you plan to spend the money anyway? If the purchase was already in your budget and the offer is not influencing you, that's a good sign.\n\nCan you pay on time, every time? Missing even one payment could trigger retroactive interest and late fees. Make sure to set reminders or, better yet, enable autopay.\n\nDo you understand the fine print? Check the repayment schedule and look for hidden fees.\n\nIf you\u2019re confident you can stick to the payment schedule and the purchase fits your financial plan, 0% financing can be a useful tool \u2014 especially if you keep your cash in a high-yield savings account and earn a little interest while you pay off the balance.\n\nThe key is discipline. Zero-interest offers work in your favor only if you follow the rules exactly. Slip up, and what seemed like a free loan can quickly turn into one of the most expensive ways to finance a purchase.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.

Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nIn an episode of her podcast Women & Money last year, Orman spoke to broadcaster Chris Wallace about the current financial landscape for Americans.\n\nIn fact, the picture is bleak. In response to Wallace\u2019s query about American\u2019s personal finances, Orman said, \u201c75 percent of the people in the United States don\u2019t have 400 dollars to their name in case of an emergency.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, A 2024 study from Northwestern Mutual shows that Americans believe they need $1.46 million to retire comfortably, but the current average retirement savings sit at just $88,000.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Orman sent Americans a call to action to get themselves on track for their future: \u201cI hereby challenge you to gift yourself more retirement security by increasing your contributions to your retirement accounts.\u201d\n\nUnsure how to start doing this? Here are three Orman-backed tips for getting your retirement savings on track .\n\nTo avoid paying tax when making a withdrawal from your retirement account, Orman recommends you go for a Roth IRA account.\n\nBecause your contributions to a Roth account are made after tax, you won\u2019t have to deal with deductions when you withdraw. Traditional IRAs, on the other hand, aren\u2019t taxed when you make contributions, so you end up paying later.\n\nIn an interview with Wall Street Journal this year, Orman explained that a 25-year-old could start putting $100 a month into an S&P 500 index fund through a Roth IRA every year until they hit 65.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very probable that you will average a 12% annual rate of return over 40 years,\u201d Orman said. \u201cAt the end of those years, you have a million dollars.\u201d\n\nMost banks and brokerage firms offer these accounts. But if you\u2019re looking to combine the tax benefits of an IRA with a traditionally recession-resistant asset, opening a gold IRA might be worth considering.\n\nThis commodity-based individual retirement account allows you to both invest in gold \u2014 a solid hedge against inflation \u2014 and benefit from the tax advantages of an IRA.\n\nA gold IRA is one option for building up your retirement fund with an inflation-hedging asset.\n\nOpening a gold IRA with the help of Goldco allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms while also providing the significant tax advantages of an IRA.\n\nWith a minimum purchase of $10,000, Goldco offers free shipping and access to a library of retirement resources. Plus, the company will match up to 10% of qualified purchases in free silver .\n\nIf you\u2019re curious whether this is the right investment to diversify your portfolio, you can download your free gold and silver information guide today .\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nRegularly revisiting your portfolio can help you ensure you\u2019re making informed decisions that are in line with your financial goals and timelines.\n\nAs Orman advised in a 2024 blog post: \u201cThis is your retirement and your money. Financial literacy is a need, not a want.\u201d\n\nOrman also once told CNBC that she recommends either stocks or exchange-traded funds ETFs that pay dividends. So even if the market sees a downturn, your investments will still provide you some income.\n\nIf you find you\u2019re still building up the diversified portfolio Orman deems so important, you can do so simply by spending money using Acorns \u2014 an automated investing app that makes investing easily accessible.\n\nAll you have to do is sign up and link your bank account. The app will automatically round up the total cost of your purchases and invest the difference in a smart portfolio of ETFs. So all it takes to help strengthen your portfolio and save for retirement is to make your everyday purchases and watch your money grow.\n\nYou can also open an IRA account with Acorns Later , and get potential tax benefits. With the Acorns Gold plan, you can get a 3% match on new IRA contributions, as well as customize your portfolio by choosing individual stocks. You can also opt for the Acorns Silver plan, which offers a 1% match on new IRA contributions.\n\nIf you sign up today, you can get a $20 bonus investment to get you started.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, only 36% of non-retirees thought their retirement savings were on track as of 2021. If you feel you could use some professional help getting retirement ready, consider reaching out to a financial advisor.\n\nIf you want advice on how much cash you should hold in your portfolio, and how to invest for safety in this market, consider finding a financial advisor through Advisor.com .\n\nThis online platform connects you with vetted financial advisors best suited to help you develop a plan for your new wealth.\n\nJust answer a few quick questions about yourself and your finances and the platform will match you with an experienced financial professional.

Make sure you aren\u2019t overpaying for your home and auto coverage.\n\nWith OfficialCarInsurance , you can easily compare car insurance rates with just a few clicks.\n\nSimply answer a few questions, and OfficialCarInsurance will show you a list of insurance offers available in your area.\n\nThere's also OfficialHomeInsurance.com , that takes the hassle out of shopping for home insurance.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nDark-colored suits and bro vests were on full display at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference this past week.\n\nI joke a little here, but this has turned into one of my favorite conferences to attend. So, why is this a must-snag ticket for me?\n\nFor starters, it's a great place to catch up with top tech executives after they present a fresh slide deck or participate in a fireside panel.\n\nThey're coming in hot with their latest thinking, usually just a few weeks removed from second quarter earnings. But they're also smack in budget planning season for the year ahead, so it's a fabulous time to pick their brains on where things are headed.\n\nI also get some new stock ideas to report on, thanks to retiring Goldman Sachs software analyst Kash Rangan.\n\nThis time I was blown away \u2014 for the third straight year \u2014 by the pace of AI growth. If AI development and capital expenditures were nearing some form of peak, I didn't pick up on it in my conversations. I continue to think this narrative is overblown, at least looking out deep into 2026.\n\n\"Revenue this year will grow over 3X. So about $13 billion in revenue from about $4 billion last year. So it's tripling on a very big base as well,\" OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) CFO Sarah Friar told me (video above; more context here ).\n\nShe declined to put a timetable on OpenAI becoming a public company, but added, \"It is a wild pace that we're on. You're defining a whole new era of AI.\"\n\nCoreWeave ( CRWV ) co-founder and CEO Michael Intrator echoed Friar's bullishness.\n\n\"The depth of the demand, the scale of the demand, the breadth of the demand is overwhelming,\" Intrator said. \"The industry's capacity to deliver the compute that is required by OpenAI, by the hyperscalers, by the enterprise, by the sovereigns, it's just layer after layer of overwhelming demand.\"\n\nCoreWeave inked an $11.9 billion five-year deal with OpenAI for AI compute capacity in March. It expanded the deal in May by $4 billion. I suspect another expansion will be in the offing in the not-too-distant future, given OpenAI's growth rates.\n\nHere are more takeaways from inside the conference. I hope they are helpful as you plan your tech trades for the week ahead and into year-end. Questions? Drop me a line @BrianSozzi on X.\n\nCoreWeave's business model continues to get mixed reviews on the Street, namely how it uses gobs of debt to fund its operations. I asked Intrator about this, and he essentially gave me a three-minute masterclass on the operations. Give this a watch to get up to speed, because CoreWeave is likely to be a hot trade one way or another for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe battle for lucrative government contracts between Palantir ( PLTR ) and Salesforce ( CRM ) is one to watch.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff told me this with a slight tongue-in-cheek nod: \"They're [Palantir] an inspiring company. You know, they even call themselves the eighth wonder of the world now. And I find them to be very inspiring. Mostly their prices. It's inspiring me. I don't know if you've seen it, it's publicly available, but they have products on there that are billions of dollars, and I am like, wait, my prices are way too low because I can't believe the prices that they're charging their customers.\"\n\nBut I came away slightly more concerned about the short-term economic outlook, especially following a host of bad reads on the labor market. The Federal Reserve may have to embark on a series of rate cuts to close out 2025 in order to reaccelerate the economy in the first half of 2026.\n\n\"Our customers are still aggressively buying our products and services and paying their bills. But ... there's a degree of stress in some segments of the consumer space. Costs of certain products and services are getting higher, and that's putting some dynamics in place,\" AT&T ( T ) CEO John Stankey said .\n\nGoldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius told me the US economy is in \"stall speed,\" with unemployment edging up. Hatzius added, \"This is a time when there's a risk of a sharper downturn. And as a policymaker and as a Fed official, you're going to be particularly focused at this point on labor market developments.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

Photo: VCG/VCG via Getty Images>\n\nZhang Guobin, founder of the Chinese semiconductor industry website eetrend.com, said domestic companies like Silergy, SGMicro, Southchip Semiconductor Technology, Joulwatt Technology, and Novosense Microelectronics would benefit from the investigation.\n\nAnalogue chips, which process real-world signals like sound, temperature and light by varying voltage and current within their circuits, were an important part of ICs, accounting for around 15 per cent of total sales of the global semiconductor market in 2024, according to data from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics and Frost & Sullivan.\n\nThese chips generally use more mature process nodes - such as those between 90 nanometres and 300nm - due to redesign costs and specific analogue requirements like lower noise as opposed to leading-edge nodes. They are mostly used in applications like power management, audio equipment, communication systems, sensors and automotive systems.\n\nChina was the world's largest consumer of analogue chips, with demand expanding rapidly over the past few years amid emerging applications such as electric vehicles, 5G communications and Internet of Things, according to a recent report by the Chinese research institute Chyxx.\n\nChina's investigation was expected to create a healthier development environment for domestic analogue chipmakers, said Zhang from eetrend.com.\n\nThese companies were mostly fabless chipmakers that had been subject to increased pressure to control costs compared with international integrated device manufacturers, which were able to handle the entire chipmaking process from design and manufacturing to sales under one roof, he added.\n\nChina's analogue chip market was estimated to reach US$44 billion in 2025 and continue to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 8.3 per cent over the next five years, thanks to \"rising cloud adoption, increasing availability of high-speed connectivity and growing adoption of IoT devices\", according to a report published in May by research firm Mordor Intelligence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

That's where IonQ has an edge.\n\nInstead of trying to create artificial qubits like most competitors, IonQ uses trapped ions, which are actual atoms. As such, they are much more stable and have lower error rates than fabricated qubits. IonQ has also built error-reduction software and other tools so the machines can produce more useful results, which is what will really matter when quantum computing starts to get adopted.\n\nIonQ is also thinking beyond just the hardware. It has been building software, compilers, and networking tools to make sure its systems can scale, and it has made acquisitions to add high-speed networking and even satellite-based quantum links. It also already has a major partnership with AstraZeneca , Amazon , and Nvidia to show how its technology can speed up drug discovery, which could be one of the biggest opportunities for the technology. The early results have been impressive, with as much as a 20x improvement in workflows.\n\nThe company has $1.6 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet after a recent equity raise, so it has the resources to keep pushing forward. Quantum computing isn't going to replace classical computing in the next few years, but it has the potential to be the next big technological innovation after artificial intelligence (AI), and IonQ is in a strong position to lead.\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has been around for a while, but it has completely reinvented itself as a leader in voice and agentic AI. The company's technology goes beyond basic speech recognition with its speech-to-meaning engine, which can actually understand natural language and intent.\n\nSoundHound has long had a presence in the automotive and restaurant markets, but its earlier acquisition of Amelia opened the door into healthcare and financial services, which are much bigger opportunities. Amelia also brought with it enterprise-grade conversational intelligence, and SoundHound has now combined the two companies' technologies into its Amelia 7.0 platform.\n\nThe platform goes beyond voice, however, and allows customers to create AI agents that can do tasks on their own, with little coding needed. It has also added real-time visual recognition so the platform can respond to voice and visual inputs together.\n\nSoundHound is currently transitioning its 15 largest customers to the Amelia 7.0 platform, but even before its introduction, the company was growing rapidly. Last quarter, its revenue surged a whopping 217% to $42.7 million, and management said it is on track to reach adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profitability by the end of 2025.\n\nSoundHound is still an early-stage company, but it is taking a unique approach to AI agents with its voice-first technology. If this helps, it becomes a leader in agentic AI, and the payoff could be big.\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) has been one of the market's best-performing stocks over the past year, up more than 500%, but the growth story might just be getting started.\n\nThe company sold off its gaming portfolio and is now a pure-play adtech platform powered by its Axon 2.0 AI engine. This technology uses machine learning to optimize ad placement, targeting, and bidding, helping mobile game developers earn more from their advertising. In its most recent quarter, revenue jumped 77% to $1.26 billion and adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $1 billion, showing just how profitable the model can be.\n\nManagement believes within the gaming industry alone that it can grow its revenue by 20% to 30% moving forward. However, it doesn't plan to stop there. It is piloting Axon 2.0 for e-commerce and web-based ads, planning an international rollout, and launching a self-serve ads manager. These moves could bring in a much broader customer base and keep the growth rate high.\n\nShort sellers have gone after the stock, but AppLovin keeps delivering quarter after quarter, and so has the stock. If its platform proves to be just as effective outside of gaming as it has inside gaming, there could still be plenty of upside from here.\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "summary": "After the frenzy of meme stocks, the new trend is to \"dividend and chill.\"",
      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nBloomberg recently reported that dividends have become \"the new hot thing\" among Gen Z retail investors, with a growing group using and promoting them as a ticket to early retirement [1].\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake \u2014 here\u2019s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThe report compares this \u201cquasi-religious investing movement\u201d to others that have sprung up in response to the economic hardships facing younger generations in America, including the struggle to afford housing and the prospect of AI taking their jobs. Many young people appear to be disillusioned with the traditional model of working a 9-to-5 job and putting away retirement savings for most of your life.\n\n\u201cThe dividend finfluencers see themselves as the sober cousins to the YOLO crew, closer in spirit to the FIRE movement, with its focus on financial independence and retiring early,\u201d says Bloomberg.\n\nBut they're not just buying shares of decades-old companies with strong dividend histories. Instead, they're putting money into ETFs that use complicated derivative formulas to pay out larger dividends. And this, experts say, reduces their potential for long-term returns.\n\nChasing dividends is an investment strategy that many people use to meet their financial goals. Here\u2019s how it normally works: Buy shares of quality, established businesses with a long history of paying and raising dividends. Hold those shares for many years. Collect dividends along the way, spend or reinvest them, and eventually retire on not just the wealth you\u2019ve accumulated in your portfolio, but the ongoing income those dividends provide.\n\nBut while investing in dividend-paying stocks or dividend ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is a fairly tried and true strategy, now, investors are taking that concept to a new level with a another type of ETF \u201coffering eye-popping yields generated by complex derivatives.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reports that these aggressive ETFs boasting yields upward of 8% have quadrupled in size in just three years to about $160 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy you may be interested in, too. But it\u2019s important to understand the pros and cons.\n\nTraditional dividend ETFs invest in companies with strong dividend histories. Derivative-based high-yield dividend ETFs create income based on options contracts \u2014 a much riskier endeavor.\n\nA common strategy seen in these ETFs is the covered call. The ETF will hold stocks it sells call options on. A call option gives a buyer the option to buy a stock at a set price by a certain date. In exchange for that right, the buyer pays a premium into the ETF. The ETF then shares those premiums with shareholders in the form of high-yield dividends. The upside, of course, is stronger returns and income you can cash out or reinvest to grow your portfolio. But these ETFs carry risks that traditional ETFs do not.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching stocks \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nBy selling covered calls, a derivative-based ETF inherently caps its potential gains. If the stocks it's selling calls on gains value, the ETF will have to sell at the lower option price its contracts call for, missing out on gains. Remember, quality stocks, historically speaking, have a tendency to gain value over time. This doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t lose value from time to time. But over a decades-long period, a good stock is likely to gain value overall. These derivative-based ETFs can miss out on those gains. And as an investor, so will you.\n\n\u201cSo, over long-term periods where you\u2019d expect stocks to have a positive return, these funds are probably going to trail the total returns of something simple like the S&P 500,\u201d said Jason Kephart, a senior principal with Morningstar\u2019s multi-strategy asset ratings team [2]. \u201cSo, that\u2019s the main thing I would think is the risk you should be aware of heading in because that\u2019s the one that\u2019s most likely going to play out.\u201d\n\nBloomberg also warns that these new ETFs come with a higher tax burden since \u201cderivatives-based payouts don\u2019t get the preferential treatment of qualified dividends and are instead taxed at ordinary income rates.\u201d\n\nOne of the most popular derivative-based income ETF is the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF.\n\nYou may want to be careful with these mega-yield ETFs, despite the larger yields they may generate at times.\n\nRemember, a big way to grow your nest egg is to have the value of your investments rise over time. Derivative-based ETFs have limited growth potential, so they may stunt your portfolio\u2019s growth, too. That could make it a lot harder to retire early \u2014 or retire comfortably at a more traditional age.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you should not invest in these ETFs at all. To make that determination, it\u2019s best to consult with a financial advisor and consider factors like your income goals and risk tolerance.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to invest in derivative-based ETFs, you may want to limit them to a portion of your portfolio and put the rest of your money into other assets that include traditional dividend stocks, growth stocks, and broad market/S&P 500 ETFs. Focus on building a well diversified portfolio that can still produce a lot of income but offer less risk and more potential upside with a suitable asset allocation. This means including stocks and ETFs that don\u2019t provide dividends because they offer other benefits like growth and value.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to keep in mind how you\u2019ll be taxed for owning dividend ETFs and management fees you will be paying.\n\nRemember, too, that living on investment income, as opposed to a paycheck from a job, hinges on having a large enough amount of money to invest in the first place \u2013 regardless of the assets you choose. A $100,000 portfolio that generates an 8% return, which some of these aggressive ETFs may do, produces $8,000 a year of income. A $1 million portfolio produces $80,000.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.

Together, they hold 6,489,161 SOL worth over $1.46 billion.\n\nLeading the competition is DeFi Development Corp, which currently commands 2,027,817 SOL worth $458.4 million.\n\nIt\u2019s a close race. In second and third place are Upexi with 2,000,518 SOL, and Sharps Technology with 2,000,000 SOL; each is valued at around $452 million.\n\nSeveral other altcoin treasuries have been established, mostly this year.\n\nJust two companies are building treasuries using the token of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange.

For instance, how many shares would you need to buy to collect $1,000 annually?\n\nHere's your answer: 48 shares. It doesn't sound like all that many shares, but there's more to consider when it comes to BlackRock stock.\n\nFirst, a review of that dividend math. BlackRock shares recently traded at about $1,100 per share, and the stock's annual dividend payout was $20.84 per share. (Its recent dividend yield was 1.9%.) If you're looking to collect about $1,000 annually, you'd divide that $1K figure by $20.84, getting 47.98. So you'd need 48 shares.\n\nThat may not seem like very many shares, but remember that each share has a $1,100 price tag. Those 48 shares would cost you about $52,800.\n\nNote that BlackRock has been raising its payout for 16 years in a row. Over the past five years, the payout increased by an annual average rate of 7.5%. So while the dividend yield isn't massive right now, it is growing at a respectable clip. If it keeps up that rate, you might be collecting $2,000 annually in dividends a decade from now.\n\nThe stock's payout ratio -- the percentage of earnings paid out in dividends -- is quite reasonable, too, at less than 50% in the most recent quarter. That leaves plenty of room for further increases.\n\nThere's a lot to like about BlackRock , such as revenue growing by double-digit percentages. So take a closer look to see if it's a good fit for your portfolio.\n\nBefore you buy stock in BlackRock, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and BlackRock wasn\u2019t one of them.

Palantir is essentially building a digital copy of a company's operations that can detect problems and solve those problems instantly.\n\nPalantir's financials suggest there is no replacement for the value it provides. It reported accelerating revenue growth over the last year. In the second quarter, revenue grew 48% year over year, compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMoreover, its net income margin was stellar at 33% in Q2, with an adjusted free cash flow margin of 57%. It's not common for a small software company in the early stages of growth to be reporting margins like Microsoft .\n\nThese margins are being driven by high prices that Palantir charges customers. For example, it recently secured a $10 billion contract with the U.S. Army for the next decade. Organizations are willing to pay up for Palantir's software because the savings realized are that big. Palantir is saving enterprises millions, even hundreds of millions in costs in some cases, providing an attractive return on investment that is driving the company's growth.\n\nPalantir stock is expensive, trading at high multiples of sales and earnings. But this is a unique software company with a huge opportunity ahead. CEO Alex Karp is aiming to grow revenue by 10x over time, which would bring annual revenue to more than $40 billion from this year's analyst estimate of $4.1 billion. Based on its current margins, that could equate to $20 billion in annual free cash flow over the long term. Applying a high-growth multiple of 50 to that would put the stock's market cap at $1 trillion.\n\nFor AI to keep advancing and transform how people work and communicate, it needs more powerful chips. Nvidia has been the biggest winner so far, but investors shouldn't overlook Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . It is the second-leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs), and it could be well positioned to meet growing demand in edge computing and AI inferencing that could send the stock from its current $250 billion market cap to $1 trillion.\n\nAs AI proliferates across the economy, people will be able to use powerful AI applications and processing on their devices, which makes edge computing a large opportunity for AMD. The company offers a range of high-performance and energy-efficient chips that are aimed at running AI devices and PCs, positioning it to benefit from a booming market estimated to be worth $327 billion by 2033, according to Grand View Research.\n\nInvestors were disappointed by the company's Q2 data center growth of 14% year over year, but management expects stronger demand once it launches its Instinct MI350 series of GPUs. As it continues to bring new solutions to the data center market, AMD's data center business should accelerate.\n\nAMD's chips are clearly addressing needs in the AI market. It announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to build AI infrastructure using AMD's GPUs and software. Meanwhile, Oracle is building a massive AI compute cluster using multiple AMD chips. AMD says it is also working with governments globally to build sovereign AI infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts expect AMD's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 30% over the next several years. Against those prospects, the stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings multiple of 40. There is enough earnings growth here to potentially triple the stock in five years, putting it easily within striking distance of reaching $1 trillion within the next decade.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "text": "\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u767c\u751f\u932f\u8aa4\n\nThe tax system feels upside down sometimes. You work a regular job, and a big chunk of your paycheck goes to taxes. Meanwhile, you hear stories about billionaires paying almost nothing. So, I asked ChatGPT: What would actually happen if the ultra-wealthy paid the same tax rates as everyone else?\n\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Means for Retirees\u2019 Taxes: Here\u2019s What It Said\n\nRead Next: 9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly Expenses\n\nIt turns out, at least according to ChatGPT, the current system isn\u2019t just unfair. More than that, the country could be getting hundreds of billions of dollars every year if things changed .\n\nChatGPT started with some shocking numbers about current tax rates. According to research from the National Bureau of Economic Research, the top 400 wealthiest Americans paid an effective tax rate of about 23.8% between 2018 and 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the average American paid around 30%, and high earners who mostly rely on wages paid closer to 45%. In some years, the richest 400 families actually paid less than the bottom 50% of households.\n\nThe most extreme example ChatGPT cited was from Oxfam, which found that in 2021, the wealthiest 400 families paid just 8.2% in federal individual income tax compared to a national average of 13%.\n\nSo, the people with the most money are paying the lowest rates. ChatGPT explained this happens because of capital gains preferences, tax loopholes and sophisticated tax planning that regular people can\u2019t access.\n\nFind Out: I Asked ChatGPT To Explain How Rich People Avoid Taxes Like I\u2019m 12 \u2014 Here\u2019s What It Said\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers on what equalizing tax rates could raise, the amounts were, quite frankly, staggering.\n\nThe most conservative estimate suggested that making billionaires pay taxes at the same rate as working-class Americans could generate $500 billion to $1 trillion per year in additional revenue.\n\nOther scenarios were even more dramatic. If the top 1% paid just 10 percentage points more in taxes, that could raise $300 billion annually or $3 trillion over 10 years.\n\nA more aggressive approach like raising billionaire tax rates by 25 percentage points could yield $800 billion or more per year. Yes, you read that number correctly.\n\nChatGPT also looked at specific policy proposals. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax could generate $113 billion annually, while Sen. Ron Wyden\u2019s billionaire income tax might add $56 billion per year.\n\nThe most ambitious estimate came from Oxfam\u2019s analysis of a comprehensive wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires, which could raise $664 billion annually.\n\nTo put these numbers in perspective, ChatGPT explained what this kind of revenue could fund. Even the conservative estimate of $500 billion per year could pay for transformative programs.\n\nThat amount could cover free public college tuition, universal pre-K programs, massive infrastructure investments and a huge healthcare expansion. It could fund comprehensive child care support and food assistance programs.\n\nThe AI emphasized that we\u2019re talking about enough money to fundamentally change how the government operates and what services it can provide.\n\nChatGPT knew the common argument that higher taxes on billionaires might discourage investment or cause wealthy people to move money offshore.\n\nBut the AI also provided counterpoints. Countries with higher tax rates on the wealthy , like Scandinavian nations, still have thriving economies and high levels of innovation.\n\nChatGPT suggested that with global cooperation on tax policy, like international minimum tax agreements, it would be harder for billionaires to simply move their money elsewhere to avoid taxes .\n\nChatGPT said political resistance from powerful lobbying interests would be \u201cintense.\u201d The people who benefit from the current system have a lot of resources to fight changes.\n\nThere are also technical challenges. Wealth taxes face administrative hurdles and potential constitutional questions. Some economists argue that dramatic tax rate increases could reduce economic growth enough to actually decrease total tax revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that billionaires often have much of their money tied up in investments. When it comes to things like stocks, they don\u2019t pay taxes on that growth until (or unless) they sell those stocks. So, it\u2019s tricky to tax them before they\u2019ve done something with the stock.\n\nChatGPT pointed out that if major economies like the United States started taxing billionaires at working-class rates, it could encourage similar moves worldwide.\n\nThis might lead to reduced global tax avoidance, more coordinated international tax policies and pressure on tax havens to reform their systems.\n\nThe AI said this could create a positive cycle where it becomes harder for the ultra-wealthy to avoid paying their fair share anywhere in the world.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s analysis showed that equalizing tax rates isn\u2019t just about fairness; it\u2019s about massive amounts of money that could transform public services.\n\nThe range of additional revenue runs from hundreds of billions to over a trillion dollars annually, depending on the specific approach. Even the most conservative estimates represent transformative amounts of funding.\n\nBut the AI was clear that achieving these changes would require major legal and political reforms. The current system didn\u2019t happen by accident and changing it would face major resistance.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n5 Luxury SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Fall 2025\n\nI Help People Retire Every Day -- Here's the Most Common Retirement Mistake People Make\n\n10 Genius Things Warren Buffett Says To Do With Your Money\n\nHow Far $750K Plus Social Security Goes in Retirement in Every US Region\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Working Class",

      "summary": "U.S. vehicle owners are hanging on to their vehicles longer and want to maintain their road-worthiness",
      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nAuto industry titan Henry Ford once said, \u201cA business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large.\u201d\n\nSo it goes in the increasingly lucrative auto parts industry, where the auto aftermarket sector is set to expand by 5.1% in 2025 (to $413.7 billion), after growing by 5.7% in 2024, according to S&P Global Mobility.\n\nIndustry analysts point to multiple reasons for the auto parts market\u2019s burgeoning growth rate.\n\nFor starters, U.S. vehicle owners are hanging on to their vehicles longer and want to maintain their roadworthiness. Add to that the rise of the electric vehicle market, where 56 million EVs will be on the road and operational by the end of 2025, and as EV growth rates have risen by 47% since 2022, S&P Global reports.\n\n\"Based on the data we\u2019re seeing, Americans are holding onto their cars for longer,\u201d said Patrick Peterson, auto expert and team leader at GoodCar, in Boston, Mass. \u201cThe average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. is now at a record high of 12.6 years, up from just 9.6 years in 2002.\u201d\n\nOne of the main reasons for that scenario is the high cost of new vehicles. \u201cThe average price of a new car has surpassed $45,000, and with high interest rates, monthly payments have become harder to afford,\u201d Peterson noted. \u201cAs a result, many people are choosing to spend money on repairs and maintenance instead of buying a new car.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the average annual cost to repair and maintain a vehicle is approximately $419.42, representing a 43.6% increase from 2019 . \u201cIn comparison, owning a new car costs much more,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cThe average annual cost of owning a new car is around $7,612, which includes insurance, maintenance, fuel, and other expenses. So, even with rising repair costs, it\u2019s still often cheaper to keep an older car than to buy a new one.\"\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by auto parts retailers, who are busier than usual right now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more activity in our service bays,\u201d said Scott Kunes, chief operating officer at Kunes Auto and RV Group in Delavan, Wis. \u201cLonger vehicle ownership means more oil changes, more brake jobs, and more replacement parts. That constant flow of maintenance work doesn\u2019t really ebb with the economy; if anything, it picks up when people hold onto cars longer. In a lot of ways, maintenance has become the new car payment.\u201d\n\nThe longer vehicles stay on the road, the more consistent the demand for parts and services becomes, making companies in this sector stable and attractive. \u201cAdditionally, many of these companies have shown consistent growth, even during economic downturns, making them a reliable option for investors seeking long-term returns,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nConducting due diligence on good auto parts stocks is no different from conducting due diligence on any other sector. These three action steps should help with your bumper-to-bumper auto parts review.\n\nExamine the company\u2019s fundamentals . For starters, reviewing how well the company\u2019s managed, its track record for making a profit, and how sustainable its growth rate. \u201cNext, consider the company\u2019s position in the market,\u201d Peterson advises. \u201cFor example, companies with strong brand recognition or a wide geographic reach tend to handle market changes better.\u201d\n\nCheck the dividend yield as well . \u201cIf a company pays regular or increasing dividends, it\u2019s often a good sign of financial health,\u201d Peterson noted.\n\nReview financials to ensure the stock is priced reasonably . \u201cThe auto parts market is competitive, so you want to ensure you're getting a good deal compared to the company\u2019s potential for earnings,\u201d Peterson added.\n\nOnce your due diligence is complete, consider adding these three sector stocks to your portfolio.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance: 35.99%\n\nThis Memphis, Tenn.-based auto parts retail chain has been consistently strong in both market performance and financial stability. \u201cThey\u2019ve been making moves to expand, and their market position remains solid, which gives me confidence in their long-term growth,\u201d Peterson noted.\n\nWhile the stock is rolling in 2025, market mavens say AZO has plenty of open road ahead. UBS analyst Michael Lasser recently reiterated his \u2018buy\u2019 call on the stock with a 15.6% target price upgrade.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance: 36.44%\n\nTrading at $108 per share in mid-September, O\u2019Reilly has garnered impressive support from auto parts industry specialists, and investors may want to take note.\n\n\u201cO'Reilly has been outperforming its competitors for a while now, and their ability to maintain a solid balance sheet while expanding its store base is impressive,\u201d Peterson noted. \u201cTheir focus on high-quality service is resonating with consumers, which positions them well for the future.\"\n\nCommercial customers love the company, too, which should placate fence-sitting investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a business customer, not investors, but we\u2019ve relied on O\u2019Reilly and NAPA for years because they tend to have what we need when we need it,\u201d said Ford Smith, founder at A1xpress, a freight and logistics services company in Freehold, N.J.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, Smith says O\u2019Reilly has \u201cbeen dependable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were investing, I\u2019d rather bet on the companies that are keeping fleets like ours on the road than the ones chasing flash,\u201d he added.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance: 22.28%\n\nTrading at $143 per share , Genuine Parts has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the annual dividend for an astounding 69 consecutive years.\n\n\u201cIn my view, GPC is a buy and long-term hold stock,\u201d said Robert R. Johnson, chairman at Economic Index Associates. \u201cOn average, it\u2019s returned 10.27% for investors over the past 15 years. That\u2019s considerably higher than the 5.13% annual return the auto parts industry has returned over that time period.\u201d\n\nGPC currently sells at a forward PE ratio of 16.37% which is a substantial discount to the market (S&P forward price-to-earnings is 22.4). \u201cPlus, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.95%,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an industry with steady demand and robust cash flow, companies in the auto parts sector make sense.\n\n\u201cVehicles still need service whether the market\u2019s up or down,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn our business, we don\u2019t replace a van just because it\u2019s getting older, but when it starts creating downtime we can\u2019t afford. Until that point, we\u2019ll put money into parts and repairs because it\u2019s the more efficient play.\u201d\n\nThat same logic applies to households right now. \u201cCompanies that sell brake pads, sensors, fluids, and core components will continue to see activity, even when new car sales slow,\u201d Smith added.",

      "summary": "Bitcoin mining firms are transforming their energy-hungry facilities into AI data centers, chasing stable contracts and higher returns as crypto profitability wanes.",
      "text": "Something went wrong\n\nWhen Core Scientific signed a $3.5 billion deal to host artificial intelligence (AI) data centers earlier this year, it wasn\u2019t chasing the next crypto token \u2014 it was chasing a steadier paycheck. Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities.\n\nBitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines \u2014 the dedicated bitcoin mining computer \u2014 for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI\u2019s explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining.\n\nIt's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset.\n\nBack in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins.\n\nHowever, the need for power\u2014the biggest input cost\u2014became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources.\n\nDue to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems\u2014skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s.\n\nThis is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure.\n\nEssentially, these miners aren\u2019t just pivoting\u2014they\u2019re retrofitting.\n\nThe cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google.\n\nFirms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.\n\nBitcoin mining has effectively \"terraformed\" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs.\n\nAs Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, \"It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute.\"\n\nThis pre-existing \"terraforming\" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.\n\nIn practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year\u2014far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center.\n\nBut AI isn\u2019t a cheap upgrade.\n\nBitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability.\n\nAs AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game\u2014one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs.\n\nWhile projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research , the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%.\n\nWith investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles.\n\nThis evolution not only repurposes idle assets but also underscores how yesterday's crypto frontiers are forging tomorrow's AI empires.",

      "summary": "Homeowners insurance premiums are rising faster than the pace of inflation, causing some buyers to rethink their searches.",
      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nAs homeowners insurance premiums hit record highs, homebuyers are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to afford them.\n\nThe average single-family homeowner is now paying almost $2,370 a year for property insurance, according to new data from ICE Mortgage Technology, up 70% in the last 5.5 years.\n\nInsurance premiums are one of the fastest-growing costs of homeownership, outpacing jumps in home prices, mortgage rates, and property taxes. Most homebuyers expect the problem to get worse. A Realtor.com survey of recent and prospective homebuyers found that 75% are worried they may be unable to afford insurance in the future, and nearly 90% are bracing for higher prices.\n\nAround the country \u2014 but especially in populous, disaster-prone states like Florida, Texas, and California \u2014 mortgage lenders, Realtors, and insurance brokers say insurance cost discussions are playing a bigger role in how buyers and sellers think about their next moves. Insurance is sometimes called one of the \u201chidden costs\u201d of ownership, alongside property taxes, maintenance expenses, and homeowners' association dues, and the rising costs are another strain on buyers struggling to deal with elevated mortgage rates and home prices near all-time highs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely that sticker shock,\u201d said John Powell, who owns an insurance agency in Plano, Texas.\n\nAround the country, premium increases have far outstripped broader inflation in recent years, and they're continuing to do so. They\u2019re up 4.9% in the first half of the year alone, and 11.3% from a year ago. Costs are rising the fastest in cities in California as the state\u2019s market adjusts to new regulations and the aftermath of January\u2019s devastating wildfires, as well as parts of North and South Carolina that experienced severe flooding last year.\n\nThe rising costs come as climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, costing insurers billions in claims tied to hurricanes, hail, and wildfires and causing them to pull out of markets where they\u2019re hemorrhaging money. Repairs are also getting more expensive as the cost of building materials and labor rises.\n\nAll of that contributes to higher premiums for consumers.\n\nRead more: Homeowners insurance: What it covers and how much you'll pay\n\nThere have always been parts of the country where insurance is especially expensive. For example, homeowners in Louisiana, Florida, and parts of Texas have long paid higher rates due to hurricane risk. The average homeowner in Miami pays $502 a month for property insurance, the highest anywhere in the country, and up from $306 at the end of 2019, according to ICE Mortgage Technology. And in New Orleans, premiums average $472 a month.\n\nBut now, higher repair costs and an uptick in roof-pummelling hailstorms have sent insurance premiums spiking even in parts of the country far from the coasts. Homeowners in Minneapolis and Des Moines, Iowa, saw their premiums rise 8% on average in the first half of this year, to $272 a month and $194 a month, respectively.\n\nKeeping up with higher insurance costs can be a strain on homebuyers, especially first-time and lower-income buyers who might be close to the maximum permissible debt-to-income ratios on their loans, said Moses Garcia, a loan officer at Veterans Lending Group in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nFive years ago, when doing pre-approvals, Garcia factored in $85 a month in insurance costs for a borrower looking for a $270,000 home in his area. Now, he estimates $120 or $130.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re up against debt-to-income guidelines, an increase of $40 or $50 here can blow the loan out of the water and not allow them to qualify anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore she moved to Okeechobee, Fla., Laura Richards, 49, didn\u2019t think much about insurance. Annual premiums on her previous home in Nashville were manageable and predictable, rising around $100 over the course of a decade.\n\nShe knew she\u2019d pay more in Florida due to hurricane risk, but she didn\u2019t expect finding and keeping insurance to be so difficult. She purchased her home from her brother and called his broker, expecting to be able to get the same policy he had. But that insurer would no longer cover the house. She found an alternative, only to be dropped by them two years later.\n\nHer new insurer recently told her she\u2019ll need to switch again next year. Though she's never filed a claim, she\u2019ll pay $2,800 a year, up from $1,400 when she moved in 2022.\n\nTo keep up with the rising costs, she\u2019s trimmed her budget, shopping for groceries at Aldi instead of Publix, a cult-favorite among Floridians. When she needs extra cash, she sometimes moonlights as a DoorDash driver.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Richards, who works in corporate communications, considers herself lucky. But she\u2019s concerned about how her elderly neighbors who live on fixed incomes and first-time homebuyers are able to afford the ballooning expenses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out \u2014 I\u2019m still youngish,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI worry about the people who are really young. Are they ever going to be able to not live with their parents? Florida is supposed to be this retirement Mecca. How are the senior citizens doing it?\u201d\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nHer worries aren\u2019t unfounded. Realtor.com found that younger buyers are more likely to change their homebuying strategy or consider new locations in response to insurance challenges. 31% of Gen Z buyers and 26% of millennials said they\u2019d shifted their strategies, compared with 6% of baby boomers. But even older buyers are worried about what\u2019s to come: Nearly a third of boomers said insurance hasn\u2019t yet affected their search, but they expect it will in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat scares me is how many people are not prepared,\u201d said Kayla-Rae Campbell, a real estate agent who works in Southern California's Inland Empire and San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles.\n\nThere, the Riverside metro area has had some of the fastest-rising insurance costs anywhere in the country, with premiums rising more than 8% in the first half of the year to $172 a month, on average. Throughout the region, Campbell has seen annual insurance costs spike by thousands of dollars when a home changes hands, even in lower-cost neighborhoods where it\u2019s only been two or three years since the last sale.\n\nShe frequently works with retirees moving inland in search of lower costs. When she shows homes in the area\u2019s 55+ communities, she advises her clients to price out the difference in insurance costs between homes that sit in the middle of the community and are more insulated from wildfire risks, versus ones on the edge, which often have prime desert views but worse fire exposure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thousands of dollars of difference \u2014 that\u2019s huge when it comes to annual planning,\u201d she said.\n\nHomeowners struggling with rising costs have few options. Anyone with a mortgage is usually required to carry property insurance. Shopping around for new insurers can lower costs, as can bundling homeowners insurance with other types of policies like auto insurance. Accepting a higher deductible also usually lowers premiums, but comes with added risk. Powell, in Texas, doesn\u2019t always recommend it.\n\n\u201cWe try to walk them through the math,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many months do you need to go claims-free to have that make sense?\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, some homeowners, especially those with paid-off houses, are opting to forego insurance altogether. In 2023, 1 in 5 homeowners without a mortgage lacked meaningful insurance, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nIt\u2019s something Richards has contemplated for the future. Despite the insurance challenges, she says she\u2019s happy she moved to Florida, which brought her closer to family and entertainment options like theme parks, cruises, and beaches.\n\n\u201cMost of us just have insurance because our mortgage company says we have to,\u201d Richards said. \u201cI don\u2019t live in fear of what could happen, except if I get a letter from my insurance company coming in.\u201d\n\nClaire Boston is a Senior Reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.\n\nSign up for the Mind Your Money newsletter\n\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nTesla said it needed to incentivize CEO Elon Musk with a record-breaking pay package in order to compete with his private companies, according to a proxy the company filed last week.\n\nThe filing outlines a share award that could be worth $1 trillion if it all pays out. Tesla also said Musk's other companies \u2014 mainly SpaceX and xAI Holdings \u2014 now account for most of his wealth and therefore will command most of his attention unless Tesla pays him more.\n\n\"A majority of Mr.\u00a0Musk's wealth is now derived from other business ventures outside of Tesla, and he has more attractive options today than ever before,\" the proxy said. The pay package of up to 423 million shares is necessary, it added, to prevent Musk from \"prioritizing other ventures.\"\n\nIt will be up to shareholders to approve the package, of course. But the proxy highlights the surging valuations of Musk's private companies and the competing interests of xAI, SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nUntil last year, the vast majority of Musk's wealth came from his Tesla stock. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegs Musk's wealth at about $385 billion, while Forbes estimates his wealth is at $436 billion. The difference is likely tied to his 2018 pay package, which is still in dispute and is valued at between $60 billion and $100 billion. If the compensation plan is restored, and/or he receives an interim comp package proposed in the proxy, Musk's net worth is closer to $436 billion.\n\nToday, less than half of that fortune comes from Tesla stock.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nBased on his current ownership of 13% of the company, Musk's Tesla shares are worth about $140 billion. Musk has argued that he needs at least 25% of voting control of Tesla to prevent the company from being taken over as it develops highly sensitive and powerful artificial intelligence technology and robots.\n\nAt SpaceX and xAI, he has more voting control, with 42% of SpaceX and a majority stake in xAI. SpaceX is planning an insider share sale that would reportedly value the company at $400 billion, nearly double its valuation last year. At the $400 billion valuation, Musk's stake would be worth about $170 billion \u2014 more than the value of his current Tesla stake.\n\nxAI's valuation has grown even faster, from $80 billion at the start of the year to a potential $200 billion in a new fundraising round. Musk owns more than 50% of the company, putting his stake well over $100 billion.\n\nTogether, Musk's stake in xAI and SpaceX are now worth nearly twice as much as his Tesla shares. Added to his stakes in Neuralink \u2014 valued at around $9 billion \u2014 and his other companies, his private company wealth eclipses his Tesla wealth.\n\nOf course, that may not be for long. If he is awarded the 423.7 million shares of restricted stock in the new 2025 compensation plan, and if Tesla hits its target valuation of $8.5 trillion, Musk's Tesla shares would be worth over $2 trillion.",

      "text": "A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nA new push by states to tax the real estate of the wealthy has sparked a backlash among brokers and potential buyers, who say the taxes punish the most important local spenders.\n\nFrom tax hikes on pricey second homes in Rhode Island and Montana to Cape Cod's proposed transfer tax on homes over $2 million and the L.A. mansion tax, state and local governments see a revenue gold mine in the pricey properties of the wealthy.\n\n\"It's a smack in the face to people who just spend money here,\" said Donna Krueger-Simmons, sales agent with Mott & Chace Sotheby's International in Watch Hill, Rhode Island.\n\nThe tax hikes are being driven by tighter state budgets and populist anger over housing costs. States are looking to offset budget cuts expected from the new tax and spending bill in Washington. At the same time, the housing market has become a tale of two buyers, with the middle class and younger families struggling to afford homes while the luxury housing market thrives from wealthy all-cash buyers.\n\nThe solution for many states: tax the homes of the rich.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nRhode Island's new levy, nicknamed \"The Taylor Swift Tax,\" is among the most extreme. The popstar bought a beach house in the state's elite Watch Hill community in 2013.\n\nThe measure imposes a new surcharge on second homes valued at more than $1 million. For non-primary residences, or those not occupied for more than 182 days a year, the state will charge $2.50 for every $500 in assessed value above the first $1 million. That charge is on top of existing property taxes and will add up to big increases for luxury homes in Newport, Watch Hill and other well-heeled, summer communities in the state.\n\nSwift's house, for instance, is assessed at around $28 million, according to local real estate records. Her current property taxes are estimated at around $201,000 a year. The new charges will add another $136,442 to her annual taxes, bringing her yearly total to $337,442 \u2013 even though locals say she rarely visits.\n\nReal estate brokers say the increase targets the very taxpayers who already contribute the most. Wealthy second-homeowners pay hefty property taxes but don't use many local services, since their primary residences are in New York; Boston; Palm Beach, Florida; or other locales. Their kids typically don't attend the local schools, and they're infrequent users of the police, fire, water and other municipal services since most stay for only 10 to 12 weeks out of the year.\n\n\"These are people who just come here for the summer, spend their money and pay their fair share of taxes,\" said Krueger-Simmons. \"They're getting penalized just because they also live somewhere else.\"\n\nBrokers and longtime residents say the summer residents of Newport, Watch Hill and other seasonal beach towns are the economic engines for local businesses, restaurants and hotels.\n\n\"You're just hurting the people who support small business,\" said Lori Joyal, of the Lila Delman Compass office in Watch Hill. \"You're chasing away the people who spend most of the money in these towns.\"\n\nRhode Island is also hiking its conveyance tax on luxury real estate starting in October. The tax on real estate sales will be an additional $3.75 for each $500 paid above $800,000 for a real estate purchase. At the same time, the state's steep estate tax deters many of the ultra-wealthy from living there full-time.\n\nBrokers say some second-home owners are considering selling and many would-be buyers are pausing their purchases. While the tax hike alone isn't expected to lead to any significant wealth flight, Joyal said potential buyers in Rhode Island are already looking at coastal towns in Connecticut as alternatives.\n\n\"It's always about choices,\" she said. \"At the end of the day it's about how they can choose to spend their discretionary dollars. Connecticut has some beautiful coastal towns without some of these other high taxes.\"\n\nMontana has passed a similar tax. The influx of Californians and other affluent newcomers who poured into the state during Covid has led to soaring home prices and growing resentment over gentrification. Meanwhile, the state's low income tax rate and lack of a sales tax has left it little room for revenue increases to handle the necessary increase in services.\n\nIn May, the state passed a two-tier property tax plan, lowering rates for full-time residents and raising taxes on second homes and short-term rentals. For primary residences and long-term rentals valued at or below the state's median home price, the tax rate will be 0.76%. Homes worth more than that will face a tiered-rate system of up to 1.9% on any value over four times the median price.\n\nThe Montana Department of Revenue expects the changes, which will start next year, will hike second-home taxes by an average of 68%. Brokers say some buyers are waiting to see the tax bills next year before making any decisions about whether to buy or sell.\n\n\"I've heard about some buyers who have put on the brakes to wait for the dust to settle and see what happens,\" said Valerie Johnson, with PureWest Christie's International Real Estate in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nJohnson said that while the tax was touted by legislators as hitting wealthy second-home owners, it will also hit longtime locals who own investment homes and rent them out for income.\n\n\"These are small businesses for many people,\" she said.\n\nManish Bhatt, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said tax hikes aimed at wealthy second-home owners may be popular politically, but they rarely make for successful or efficient tax policy. Real property tax reform should be broad based, rather than focused on taxpayers who are singled out just because they don't live in a community full-time, he said.\n\n\"There is a grab to find revenue right now,\" he said. \"But taxing second-home owners could have the opposite impact \u2013 dissuading people from owning a second home or continue to own in those communities.\"\n\nWhile the new taxes alone might not drive out the wealthy, \"we do know that taxes are important to businesses and individuals and could cause people to make a decision to buy in another nearby state,\" Bhatt said.\n\nThe projected revenue from the new taxes may also disappoint. When Los Angeles passed its so-called \"mansion tax\" in 2022, proponents touted revenue projections of between $600 million to $1.1 billion a year. The tax, imposed on real estate sales over $5 million, has only raised $785 million after more than two years, according to the Los Angeles Housing Department.\n\nHigher interest rates that hurt the housing market have played a role, experts say. Yet Michael Manville, professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said wealthy buyers and sellers also reduced transactions in response to the tax.\n\n\"The lower revenue is a reason to be concerned because it suggests that the tax might actually be reducing transactions, which in turn can reduce housing production and property tax revenue,\" he said.",

      "summary": "The diversification to attract new customers comes as the luxury sector grapples with an industry-wide slowdown, U.S. tariffs, and wider cost pressures.",
      "text": "With nearly all shoppers facing a sense of sticker price shock, some luxury fashion lines are experimenting with new, less pricey products in a bid to remain relevant and attract new consumers.\n\nLouis Vuitton's long-awaited beauty collection hit branded stores and concessions last month, marking the latest iteration for the 171-year-old LVMH -owned luxury titan.\n\nAnd while the signature scented lipsticks don't come cheap at $160 a pop, it indicates a wider shift among luxury players trying to get more shoppers through the door without diluting their flagship offerings.\n\n\"I think this is a very appropriate move,\" Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at\u00a0Bernstein, who has extensively studied diversification of luxury brands, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Mega-brands would be wise not to sell too many of their core products and use lower absolute price categories to engage with a broader [range of] aspirational consumers,\" he noted.\n\nWith esteemed makeup artist Pat McGrath as creative director, Louis Vuitton may be hoping that the range of 55 lipsticks, 10 lip balms and eight eyeshadow palettes \u2014 and an accompanying $2,890 mini trunk carry case \u2014 will appeal to her cult following of young, U.S. consumers.\n\nIt follows similar expansions into cosmetics by brands such as Prada , LVMH's Celine, Dries Van Noten and, soon, Miu Miu. \"Beauty is an attractive category from a financial viewpoint, as it offers high GM% [gross margins],\" Bernstein said in a note in March.\n\nMeanwhile, the explosive popularity of Labubu keychains has birthed a new wave of extravagant bag charms, including from Coach, Longchamp and a $1,420 option from Louis Vuitton, as brands bet that the \"treatonomics\" trend will tempt shoppers to splurge on little luxuries even as they cut back on bigger ticket items.\n\nThe luxury diversification comes as the sector grapples with an industry-wide slowdown, U.S. tariffs, and wider cost pressures.\n\n\"Brands are utilizing the playbook from 2015, 2016,\" Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said via email, referring to another period of softness in the industry, amid a dip in Chinese demand.\n\n\"Back then, brands turned to streetwear, e.g. sneakers, smaller handbags and bag charms,\" she said. \"Those efforts have proved quite successful in the past with growing share of millennial consumer buying, supported by a general pick-up in sentiment.\"\n\nThis time around, the luxury industry has been under pressure since 2022, when a Covid-era boom gave way to malaise as consumers grew weary of steep \u2014 and often what they deemed unmerited \u2014 price increases.\n\nBank of America Securities said in a 2022 report that the sector's revenue and growth going forward would be determined by three factors: doubling the total addressable market (TAM) including with new products; increasing cultural relevance; and ongoing brand reinvestment to increase desirability.\n\n\"New categories grow the TAM and increase cultural relevance,\" Ashley Wallace, managing director, European consumer discretionary at Bank of America Securities, and one of the report's authors, told CNBC via email.\n\nOther examples of new luxury categories include footwear, eyewear, perfume and small leather goods.\n\nLower price entry points can, in turn, bring a younger and broader consumer base into a brand's ecosystem, with the hope that shoppers will then develop a sense of brand loyalty over time.\n\n\"Younger customers have become increasingly engaged with luxury supported by cultural relevance, online engagement and advertising. As these customers move up the income ladder, accumulate more assets and intergenerational transfer of wealth continues, this younger generation will control a greater share of global wealth and consumption power therefore underpinning the structural tailwind of luxury demand,\" BofA Securities said in the report.\n\nLVMH's Chief Financial Officer Cecile Cabanis acknowledged that strategy during the French luxury conglomerate's second quarter earnings call in July.\n\n\"You also need to connect with the younger generation,\" she told investors. \"You also need to have some offer where you can meet them, onboard them and then they can go through your value ladder.\"\n\n\"We refuse to do that with cheap bags. The way we do it is Vuitton. Vuitton is always the best desirability, always the best quality. So you use accessible product categories in order to do it: perfume, small leather goods, and there are a few others. That's really how we work on [the] portfolio,\" she said.\n\nBut brands have a fine balance to strike in broadening their appeal without diluting the exclusivity of their labels.\n\nSokolova said that the push into new, lower price categories ought to be done alongside the expansion of a brand's more expensive product offerings, to ensure it continues to cater to more affluent consumers.\n\nSome brands have learnt that lesson the hard way. Heavy discounting from the likes of Burberry and Gucci in the past has left them struggling to regain their status among high spenders.\n\nWhether brands' latest phase of category diversification will prove successful in the current era of economic pressures and compressed consumer spending still remains to be seen, however.\n\n\"It was successful 10 years ago. So far, it's [too] early to say,\" Sokolova said.\n\n\"Any brand has to establish itself with the new generation of consumers, otherwise its appeal will age together with the current buyers. [But] ultimately, aspirational consumers are more economically sensitive so stronger economy is needed for them to sustainably grow purchases.\"",

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nThe revolution in private markets and private lending is setting the stage for a sweeping investor shift out of publicly traded stocks and into alternatives, according to Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan.\n\nWith the stock market increasingly driven by passive investing and indexing, and dominated by a handful of mega-tech stocks, investors seeking diversification will need to start turning to the rapidly expanding private markets, Rowan told CNBC.\n\n\"I do think [investing] is broken,\" he said. \"We had this notion 40 years ago that private was risky and public was safe. What if that's just fundamentally wrong?\"\n\nRowan and Apollo are at the forefront of a tectonic shift in the investing landscape, with the lines between public and private markets blurring and the burgeoning business of private credit funding a growing share of corporate America's growth.\n\nThe Inside Alts newsletter with Robert Frank and Leslie Picker is your guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nA handful of private equity giants are now muscling out the banks and stock markets to make trillions of dollars of loans and open up new opportunities \u2013 and risks \u2013 for investors.\n\nApollo, Blackstone and KKR together now have more than $2.6 trillion of assets under management, more than quadruple what they held a decade ago. Apollo alone has $840 billion in assets, up from $40 billion in 2008, Rowan said.\n\n\"I'd like to attribute that to good management, but that wouldn't be true,\" Rowan said. \"The answer is, there are just fundamental factors that are reshaping and growing private markets.\"\n\nThose factors start with the post-financial crisis regulations that curbed bank lending and allowed the private credit market to step in and provide long-term (and in many cases riskier) loans to large corporate borrowers.\n\nPrivate credit as an investment class expanded, first among endowments, sovereign wealth funds and pensions and later among family offices and high-net-worth investors. With returns of up to 15% or more, hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into private credit funds.\n\nAt the same time, the effectiveness of the 60-40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has become outdated, Rowan said. The rise of exchange-traded funds and indexing means most investors do little research about the individual stocks they own. Even the indexes are now driven by a handful of mega-tech stocks. And as stocks and bonds have become more correlated, diversification needs to be redefined.\n\nRowan said the decline in the number of publicly traded companies \u2013 from 8,000 in the 1990s to about 4,000 today \u2013 means investors aren't actually getting the investment benefits of the American economy.\n\n\"When we own the S&P 500, do we actually own the 500?\" he said. \"Ten stocks are now 40% of the index. We have lost the ability to really invest in a way that reflects the strength of the U.S. market, or, quite frankly, the strength of any market.\"\n\nInstead, he said, investors will start allocating more of their fixed income and their equities portfolios in private investments.\n\nPrivate credit firms have about $450 billion available to invest, according to Preqin.\n\nAnd today's private credit loans often involve big, publicly traded companies. Meta Platforms , for instance, just secured $29 billion in financing from a group led by Blue Owl Capital and Pacific Investment Management Co. for a data center in Louisiana.\n\nAir France , AB InBev , Intel and AT&T have all turned to Apollo for loans rather than traditional banks. Investors and companies are just waking up to the potential size of the market, Rowan said.\n\n\"If private credit is direct lending, leverage lending, below investment grade, it's roughly a $1.5 trillion market,\" he said. \"If private credit is investment grade and the low investment grade, it's a $40 trillion market today. Today, the vast majority of what we do is investment grade, and that always shocks people.\"\n\nWhile the risks of investing in private credit are well known, Rowan said they're often misunderstood. Investing in a loan to Meta, for instance, shouldn't be considered more risky than buying its stock through an index.\n\n\"What if private is both safe and risky, and public is both safe and risky, and they are just differing degrees of liquidity?\" he said. \"That's the world I think we're in.\"\n\nAs alternatives start to move down the investing ladder, from institutions to family offices and eventually to retail investors, concerns are growing that retail investors would be putting a portion of their retirement savings into less liquid assets. After all, Harvard, Yale and other endowments are now struggling to sell a portion of their private equity and alternatives investments at discounts to raise needed cash.\n\nRowan said the rise of new funds, market makers and ETF products will provide increasing levels of liquidity as the private credit world matures. Yet, he said some level of illiquidity is important for higher returns.\n\n\"If you work with Apollo today and you want to be 100% private investment grade, every 30 days, you can take 100% of your money out,\" he said. \"As an investor, if you don't have the capacity to bear 30 days of illiquidity, you should not be in private markets.\"\n\nLast month, the Trump administration issued an executive order that will start opening the door for more alternative investments and crypto in 401(k) plans. Rowan said the process will take time but that the experience of countries that allow more alternatives in national retirement plans \u2013 including Australia, Israel and Mexico \u2013 bodes well for U.S. investors.\n\nExpanding access will also eventually lead to lower fees, stronger performance and more transparency in an investment segment that's still widely seen as opaque.\n\n\"There's no market in the world where transparency and opening up the market has not brought better access, lower prices and a weeding out of the poor managers,\" he said.",

      "text": "Uncertainty around tariffs has caused even the wealthiest buyers of Lamborghini supercars to hold off on their purchases, CEO Stephan Winkelmann told CNBC.\n\nWhile the White House recently announced an agreement with Europe on a 15% tariff rate, that rate hasn't yet taken effect for cars. Lamborghini and other European automakers are still paying a tariff rate of 27.5% on exports to the U.S. With the price of a Lamborghini starting at $400,000, many buyers are choosing to wait for more stable tariff rates before buying, Winkelmann said.\n\n\"Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place,\" Winkelmann said. \"Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nWherever the final tariff rate settles, however, Winkelmann said the levies will have some impact on the company's business. He said Lamborghinis can't be produced in the U.S., since the \"made in Italy\" promise is core to the brand. And he said that even the wealthy are sensitive to price increases.\n\n\"They are millionaires or billionaires for a reason, so they know what they're doing and why they're doing things,\" he said. \"For us, free trade is the right approach. We all know that is what we want. But then there is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity, since we are in business. ... We are ready to face whatever comes.\"\n\nFor now, the company is fairly insulated from any immediate drop-off in demand, since it has a large back order. Cars being delivered today were ordered a year or two ago. Lamborghini announced this summer to dealers that prices would increase by 7% for the Temerario and Urus models and 10% for the Revuelto.\n\nThe company, owned by Volkswagen 's Audi Group, is also riding high from a wave of new models. It reported record revenue in 2024 of more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) and deliveries of 10,867 cars. It's launched three new models since 2023, all plug-in hybrids: the 8-cylinder Temerario, which replaces the Huracan; the 12-cylinder Revuelto, which replaces the Aventador; and the Urus SE, a hybrid SUV.\n\nFor an upcoming fourth model, Lamborghini had announced an all-electric grand touring car to debut sometime in 2028. But Winkelmann said with EV demand slowing, the company is considering releasing it as a hybrid instead and will decide by the end of the year.\n\n\"There is a flattening in the acceptance of electric cars, not only at the high end and exclusive supercars, but also in the general market,\" he said. \"So the trend is going to be delayed in general, and we have to decide. For a car like Lamborghini, it's not important to be the first one to show a new technology, but to be there when it's accepted and to have the best technology at that time.\"\n\nLast week at Monterey Car Week, Lamborghini unveiled a new limited-production supercar called the Fenomeno. It's the fastest and most powerful Lambo yet, boasting 1,080 horsepower and 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds thanks to a 6.5-liter, V-12 engine paired with three electric motors.\n\nLamborghini will make only 29 Fenomenos, which are part of what Winkelmann calls the \"few-offs\" strategy of super-rare, hyper-performance versions of its current lineup for top clients.\n\nAlso helping the company: a surge in wealth around the world that's becoming younger and more diverse. Lamborghini owners have an average of five cars in their garage, and owners of the higher-priced Lambos have an average of 10 cars. The average age of the Lamborghini buyer now is under 45, and in Asia it's under 30, he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of countries where we have very young customers,\" he said. \"We have the second generation of wealth. But we also have a very young customer base of entrepreneurs who made their money themselves.\"\n\nRelative to the growth in global wealth, however, Lamborghini's production has remained small. And while the U.S. is still its largest market, Lamborghini carefully manages supply in every country to make sure the brand remains exclusive and special, Winkelmann said.\n\n\"We will always look to make sure we do not crowd one market, and to have always a global view where we are selling the cars,\" he said.\n\nWomen, he said, will also be a key driver. The Urus has welcomed more women buyers to the brand, and Lamborghini is holding more women-focused events, like the \"She Drives a Lambo\" driving gatherings.\n\n\"We have always been a very male-driven brand, very attractive to males with the design and performance,\" Winkelmann said. \"But on the other side, we are seeing that with the Urus, we have a lot more women stepping into the brand and having confidence with the brand.\"",

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nUp to $400 million worth of classic cars will roll across the auction block in Monterey and Pebble Beach this week, marking the biggest test of the year for the collectible car market and wealthy owners.\n\nAn estimated 1,140 classic cars will come up for sale at Monterey Car Week, the annual gathering of classic car collectors from around the world. The sales total is estimated to come in between $367 million and $409 million, according to Hagerty. The midpoint of that range, at $388 million, would mark the third year of declines in sales, and an 18% drop from the recent peak of $471 million in 2022.\n\nThe high end of the market is the weakest. The Monterey auctions \u2013 held by RM Sotheby's, Gooding & Co., Mecum, Bonhams and others \u2013 have traditionally featured at least a half-dozen cars priced at $10 million or more. This year there's only one \u2013 the fewest in over a decade. The average sale price has dropped to $473,000 this year from $477,000 last year.\n\n\"Pebble Beach is the annual health check on the market,\" said Simon Kidston, a classic car advisor and dealer. \"Everybody waits to see what happens at Pebble Beach before committing to a major decision the rest of the year.\"\n\nLike the art market and other types of collectibles, classic cars have been in slow decline since the pandemic rally in 2021 and 2022. Collectibles prices are down 2.7% over the past 12 months, according to the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index. Classic car prices are down 0.2% overall \u2013 better than the 20% drop in the art market but not as strong as jewelry (up 2.5%) or coins (up 13%).\n\nClassic car dealers and auctioneers blame global uncertainty, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with weakness in China. Higher interest rates are also a factor, raising the opportunity cost of buying a classic car, since risk-free cash still earns over 4% or more. Some also point to a surging stock market for the past three years, which makes collectibles relatively less attractive.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nYet experts say the biggest reason for the classic car slowdown is a generational shift. Baby boomers, who have powered the classic car market for decades, are aging out or downsizing. The new generation of millennials and Gen Zers, who are coming into wealth and collecting, want newer and fewer collectible cars. The shift is expected to accelerate as an estimated $100 trillion is passed from older to younger generations, giving fuel to the new breed of collector.\n\n\"It's a big rotation,\" said McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty, the classic car insurance, auction and events company. \"Some of the older-guard collectors are framing it, 'The market is soft at the top end.' But there's a lot of depth in this market. It's just rotating to younger buyers and newer cars.\"\n\nThat rotation has left the market for 1950s and 1960s cars with oversupply and falling prices. Many baby boomers are trying to clear their garages and sell, while others are passing their cars on to their kids, who often don't share the same passion.\n\nGooding & Co. is selling three Ferrari 250 GT California Spiders this week, including the most expensive lot of the week, a 1961 250 GT SWB California Spider with an alloy body and original hardtop estimated at over $20 million. \"Cal Spiders,\" as they're known, were made famous in the movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" have long been a rare and special sighting at auctions. Seeing three at the same auction series is highly unusual.\n\nKidston said the alloy body Cal Spider would have likely fetched $25 million to $30 million a few years ago.\n\n\"It's one of the great road cars of all time,\" he said. \"It has intrinsic value, with provenance, sophistication, beauty and usability.\"\n\nPrices and demand for many cars that are over 50 years old are down as much as 20% to 30% from the peaks, dealers and brokers say.\n\n\"It's just the question of what clears the market, and can their egos handle it,\" Hagerty said. \"If it's an $18 million car, and it becomes a $13 million car, it's still a multimillion-dollar car, which is pretty amazing.\"\n\nHagerty said that falling prices have driven more sales to the private market, directly between buyer and seller, rather than to the auctions. Sellers with prominent cars don't want their discounted sales prices to be public, so they opt to sell privately.\n\n\"That way nobody has to feel embarrassed,\" Hagerty said. \"We're seeing a surprisingly large amount of private sales. Sometimes a car will hit the market and sell in a couple of hours and close by the end of the day.\"\n\nAt the same time, auctions of newer super cars are skyrocketing. Millennials and Gen Zers are bidding up prices for rare cars from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. They also prefer cars that are more affordable and practical. Rather than keeping a $10 million 1962 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta locked up in a private Garage Mahal, the new breed wants post-1980s Porsches, BMWs and later-model Ferraris they can enjoy every day and not have to constantly repair.\n\nAlong with affordable exotics, young collectors are also paying up for supercars, especially rare and highly specific Paganis, Bugattis and Rufs, the boutique German builder. A 1989 Ruf CTR \"Yellowbird\" sold in March for a record $6 million at Gooding & Co. at the Amelia Island sales.\n\nTwo years ago, the average model year of the cars being sold at Pebble was 1964. This year it's 1974, which still underestimates the bar-bell distribution of cars from the 1950s at one end and the 1980s and 1990s cars at the other.\n\nSales of modern supercars \u2014 defined as those from 1975 or later \u2013 will likely overtake sales of so-called \"Enzo-era\" Ferraris (made before 1988) at Monterey for the first time, according to Hagerty.\n\nSome experts even worry that the modern supercar segment has become over-inflated and speculative. Like momentum trades in the stock market, which retail investors buy on the basic premise that someone else will buy it for more, modern supercars seem to be rising indiscriminately.\n\n\"If it's all solely reduced to what is more saleable, then collecting becomes very superficial,\" Kidston said. \"I don't believe collecting should be ruled by investing. You should keep an eye on the financial implications of what you buy. But it should not be the be-all and end-all. Otherwise it just becomes like bitcoin.\"\n\nHere are the top lots from Monterey Car Week, compiled by Hagerty :\n\nSold by Gooding & Co., estimated at more than $20 million\n\nSold by RM Sotheby's, estimated at $8.5 million to $9.5 million\n\nSold by Gooding & Co., estimated at $8 million to $10 million\n\nSold by Gooding & Co., estimated at $8 million to $10 million\n\nSold by Gooding & Co., estimated at $7.5 million to $9 million\n\nSold by Bonhams, estimated at $7 million to $9 million",

      "text": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nA leading advisory group to the wealth management industry has launched a crowdsourced list of wealth terms it hopes will reduce confusion and marketing hype.\n\nThe Ultra High Net Worth Institute, a nonprofit focused on improving services to wealthy families and investors, recently unveiled its \" Wealthesaurus \" \u2014 a list of over 80 terms commonly used and abused in the wealth management business. The list, which will be continually updated and expanded based on input from wealthy investors and advisors, aims to define the new language of wealth management and create accepted standards for communicating with clients.\n\n\"There are a lot of garbage terms, a lot of marketing terms being tossed around,\" said Jim Grubman, content and curriculum chair at the Ultra High Net Worth Institute and the founder of Family Wealth Consulting. \"The motivation on a lot of this is to counteract some of the BS in the field.\"\n\nThe need for a credible wealth Wikipedia follows an explosion of gimmicks, false labels and misleading hype in the business of managing the fortunes of the wealthy.\n\nIn 2024, households worth $5 million or more controlled an estimated $49 trillion in financial wealth, more than half of the nation's total, according to Cerulli Associates. With assets growing fastest at the top of the wealth ladder, the competition for ultra-wealthy investors and family offices has grown fierce among private banks, wirehouses, registered investment advisors, private equity firms and boutiques. With that growth has come a barrage of inflated brand language.\n\nTerms like \"family office services,\" \"holistic advice\" and \"assets under advisement\" are used indiscriminately, making it harder than ever for clients to navigate an industry already impenetrable for nonfinancial experts.\n\nOne of the most egregious violations is the term \"multifamily office.\" Traditionally, a multifamily office is a single family office that's expanded to serve a small number of outside families or family members. Today, dozens of RIAs, boutique managers and even large advisory firms call themselves multifamily offices, trading off the exclusivity and bespoke services implied by a true family office.\n\n\"Some industry observers believe the term has no established basis and should never be used,\" according to the Wealthesaurus entry for multifamily office. \"Most professionals simply recognize that the term has had growing recognition over the past thirty years, even if there is inadequate validity or consistency in its use.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nTo comply with the Wealthesaurus definition, multifamily offices need four specific attributes, from certain clients (at least 10 complex, multigenerational families with a median net worth of at least $30 million) to specific services, service delivery (no conflicts of interest) and experience.\n\nAnother contentious term is \"assets under advisement.\" Firms often toss around asset terms to appear to manage more client money than they actually do. Some firms use \"assets under management (AUM),\" while others say \"assets under advisement (AUA)\" and others tout \"assets under administration (AUAdmin).\" Clients rarely know the difference.\n\nThe Wealthesaurus gives highly specific definitions of each, with the focus for assets under advisement being firms that serve as fiduciaries (another debated term). It says clients should ask wealth managers specifically how they break out assets under management and assets under advisement.\n\n\"Some firms include AUM in their calculation of AUA without making it clear they are doing so, while others report AUM and AUA separately,\" according to the Wealthesaurus. \"To address this problem if these amounts are being evaluated, firms should be asked to explain how they calculate their AUA.\"\n\nGrubman said the idea for the Wealthesaurus started with an unexpected problem at the Ultra High Net Worth Institute. The Institute was founded in 2019 by Steve Prostano, a longtime advisory to wealthy families and private business owners, who felt that clients needed unbiased help understanding and navigating the industry. The Institute, which counts the leaders of dozens of top wealth management firms, advisory firms and specialists on its boards, also aims to promote best practices and standards in the industry.\n\nTwo years ago, the Institute started developing what it calls the Integrated Family Wealth Management Initiative, looking at the sweeping changes in the industry in recent years and how it could better serve clients. The group's discussions hit a problem: They often couldn't agree on certain words.\n\n\"We would use a term and someone would say 'Um, actually I think it's this,'\" Grubman said. \"And someone else would say 'I remember from 15 years ago it was defined like that.' It was amazing the differences people had, even around words like family enterprise.\"\n\nGrubman and Tara Kehoe, the Institute's library manager, started compiling an internal glossary and crowdsourced definitions with members of the group. Over time, the list grew and they decided to create a public version to better help clients and firms.\n\nThey considered calling it Wealthipedia, but the name was taken so they arrived at Wealthesaurus and added a dinosaur mascot. Grubman said the Institute welcomes suggested terms and definitions from other wealth management experts and clients in hopes of expanding its use. Kehoe said engagement has been high \u2014 with new users spending an average of over seven minutes on the recently launched site.\n\n\"They're clicking from term to term and really using the resource,\" Kehoe said.\n\nThe site doesn't aspire to be a comprehensive guide to all wealth management terms. There are no explainers on GRATS, or FLiPs or SCINS from the estate planning world, or SMAs and PPVAs in investing, or the myriad other products that make wealthy investors' heads spin. Grubman said the Institute didn't want to include products or terms that investors could easily look up on the web. For those kinds of product terms, the Wealthesaurus website includes links to a variety of online investing guides, including the Charles Schwab Investing Glossary and Investopedia and the SEC Glossary.\n\n\"We looked for terms that were important to the field, or where the other definitions out there were so full of jargon,\" Grubman said. \"Wading through the definition of assets under advisement on the SEC website is a nightmare, for instance. So we wanted to create this for clients.\"\n\nAs the business of advising wealthy families increasingly cuts across industries \u2014 from trust and estate planners to accountants, real estate advisors, philanthropy consultants, aviation and fleet experts, and even concierge doctors and other specialists \u2014 the Wealthesaurus can also be a bridge between disciplines.\n\nThe Wealthesaurus even has a defined term for \"ultra high net worth,\" a phrase used throughout the luxury and banking worlds with little context.\n\nThe Wealthesaurus says the most common definition of \"high net worth\" is a client with between $5 million and $30 million. \"Ultra high net worth\" typically means $30 million or more. It cautioned, however, that \"with inflation and the significant expansion of global wealth since 2000, more firms are considering the modern threshold to the top UHNW level to be $100 million.\"",

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nAmerican boat buyers and European shipyards are scrambling to assess the damage from the proposed U.S. 15% tariffs on European-made goods.\n\nWith many of the world's recreational boats and yachts made in Europe, and most of the biggest buyers in the U.S., industry experts are bracing for the fallout from President Donald Trump 's Monday tariff announcement.\n\nThe European Boating Industry issued a statement this week saying, \"The U.S. is the most important export market for the recreational boating industry in Europe. The 15% tariff rate presents serious challenges for businesses in Europe.\"\n\nGranted, most Americans can who buy a $10 million or $100 million yacht can likely afford another 15% tax. Yet brokers said the cost equation for many buyers will change with the tariffs.\n\n\"I don't know any stupid rich people,\" said Kevin Merrigan, chairman of Northrop & Johnson, the yacht brokerage firm. \"What matters to them matters. If they hear they're going to have to spend another 15%, it has an impact.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nMost boat contracts require the builder to pay duties. Yet attorneys said the new tariffs aren't likely to fall under existing duties, and the buyers will likely have to pay a portion, if not the majority. Brokers said many buyers who purchased their yachts a year or two ago \u2014 since a specialized build can take three years from start to finish \u2014are negotiating now with the shipyards.\n\nIn the meantime, brokers said the wealthy will do what they typically do when faced with a new tax \u2014 find a way around it. The most common strategy will likely be to register the boat in another country, known as \"foreign flagging.\"\n\nAn American buyer can register their yacht in one of several countries that have agreements with the U.S. The most common are the Cayman Islands, the Marshall Islands, Malta and Jamaica, brokers said. By registering the yacht abroad, the owner can enter the U.S. as a visiting vessel and therefore avoid the tariff.\n\nThere are restrictions and rules, and special cruising permits are required. And it can cost $5,000 to over $20,000 to register in another country. But the savings on a multimillion-dollar yacht are substantial.\n\n\"If it's never technically imported and it never crosses the customs border line, the tariff doesn't apply,\" said Michael Moore, a maritime attorney with Moore & Co.\n\nRegistering in another country usually only makes financial and logistical sense for larger yachts, while smaller boats (say, those under 45 feet) will still likely end up paying the tariff. In that sense, the new tariff regime will create a new class of have-yachts and have-superyachts, with the super-yachters best equipped to escape the 15% tax.\n\nBrokers said the tariffs could increase demand for U.S. yacht makers like Westport, Trinity or Burger Boat Company. And with demand for preowned yachts in a slump after a post-Covid surge, many hope sales and prices for preowned yachts already registered in the U.S. will strengthen.\n\n\"That's my hope,\" Merrigan said. \"That's what we're all hoping.\"",

      "text": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nArtificial intelligence startups have minted dozens of new billionaires this year, adding to an AI boom that's quickly becoming the largest wealth creation spree in recent history.\n\nBlockbuster fundraising rounds this year for Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, OpenAI, Anysphere and other startups have created vast new paper fortunes and propelled valuations to record levels. There are now 498 AI \"unicorns,\" or private AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights. Fully 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million, the firm said.\n\nCombined with the soaring stock prices of Nvidia , Meta , Microsoft and other publicly traded AI-related firms, along with the infrastructure companies that are building data centers and computing power and the huge payouts for AI engineers, AI is creating personal wealth on a scale that makes the past two tech waves look like warmups.\n\n\"Going back over 100 years of data, we have never seen wealth created at this size and speed,\" said Andrew McAfee, principal researcher at MIT. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nA new crop of billionaires is rising with sky-rocketing valuations. In March, Bloomberg estimated that four of the largest private AI companies had created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.\n\nMira Murati , who left Open AI last September, launched Thinking Machines Lab in February. By July, she raised $2 billion in the largest seed round in history, giving the company a $12 billion valuation, according to reports.\n\nAnthropic AI is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion, nearly three times its valuation in March. CEO Dario Amodei and its six other founders are now likely multibillionaires, according to people familiar with the company.\n\nAnysphere was valued at $9.9 billion in a June fundraise and just weeks later was reportedly offered a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion, likely making its 25-year-old founder and CEO, Michael Truell, a billionaire.\n\nGranted, most of the AI wealth creation is in private companies, making it difficult for equity holders and founders to cash out. Unlike the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when a flood of companies went public, today's AI startups can stay private for longer given the constant investment from venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and other tech investors.\n\nAt the same time, the rapid growth of secondary markets is allowing equity owners of private companies to sell their shares to other investors and provide liquidity. Structured secondary sales or tender offers are becoming widespread. Many founders can also borrow against their equity.\n\nOpen AI is holding talks for a secondary share sale to provide cash to employees. Its proposed valuation of $500 billion follows the company's fundraise in March that provided a $300 billion valuation.\n\nDozens of private firms are being acquired or merging, also providing liquidity. After Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, founder Alexandr Wang joined Meta's AI team. There have been 73 liquidity events \u2014 including mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, reverse mergers or corporate majority stakes \u2014 since 2023, according to CB Insights. Following the Meta deal, Scale AI's co-founder, Lucy Guo, who left the company in 2018, bought a mansion in LA's Hollywood Hills for around $30 million.\n\nStill, the AI surge is largely centered in the Bay Area, reminiscent of the dot-com era. Last year, Silicon Valley companies raised more than $35 billion in venture funding, according to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies. San Francisco now has more billionaires than New York, with 82 compared with New York's 66, according to New World Wealth and Henley & Partners. The Bay Area's millionaire population has doubled over the past decade, compared with New York's growth of 45%.\n\nMore homes sold above $20 million in San Francisco last year than in any other year in history, according to Sotheby's International Realty. Rising rents, home prices and demand in the city, attributed in large part to AI, mark a sharp turnaround for a city facing a \"doom loop\" just a few years ago.\n\n\"It's astonishing how geographically concentrated this AI wave is,\" said McAfee, who is also co-director of MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. \"The people who know how to found and fund and grow tech companies are there. I've heard people say for 25 years 'This is the end of the Silicon Valley' or some other place is 'the new Silicon Valley.' But Silicon Valley is still Silicon Valley.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nWith time, and initial public offerings, many of today's private AI fortunes will eventually become more liquid, providing a historic opportunity for wealth management firms. All of the major private banks, wirehouses, independent advisors and boutique firms are cozying up to the AI elite in hopes of winning their business, according to tech advisors.\n\nLike the dot-com millionaires, however, luring the AI wealthy may be challenging for traditional wealth management companies. Simon Krinsky, executive managing director at Pathstone and former managing director at Hall Capital Partners in San Francisco, said most AI wealth is locked up in private companies and therefore can't be turned into wealth management accounts.\n\n\"I would say a much higher percentage of the ultimate wealth being created is illiquid,\" he said. \"There are ways of getting liquidity, but it's tiny compared to being employed at Meta or Google\" or another megacap publicly traded tech company.\n\nEventually, those fortunes will become liquid and prized by wealth management firms. Krinsky said the AI wealthy are likely to follow similar client patterns as the newly rich dot-commers of the 1990s. Initially, the dot-commers used their excess liquidity and assets to invest in similar tech companies they knew through their networks, colleagues or shared investors. He said the same is likely true for the AI wealthy.\n\n\"Everybody turned around and invested with their friends in the same kind of companies that created their own wealth,\" he said.\n\nAfter discovering the perils of having all their wealth concentrated in one highly volatile and speculative industry, the dot-commers turned to wealth management. And being born disruptors, many turned their capital and skills toward reinventing the wealth management industry in their image. Netscape founder Jim Clark, for instance, helped launch MyCFO, a response to his dislike of bankers and the industry.\n\nKrinksy said today's AI entrepreneurs are likely to follow the same path, with huge potential for AI to disrupt \u2014 if not replace \u2014 many of the traditional functions of wealth management.\n\nUltimately, however, the ultra-wealthy AI founders will discover the need for the traditional, personalized service that only dedicated wealth management teams can provide, whether it's around taxes, inheritances and estate planning, or philanthropy advice and portfolio construction.\n\n\"After people were beaten up or bruised up in the early 2000s, they came around to appreciating some degree of diversification and maybe hiring a professional manager to protect them from themselves,\" Krinksy said. \"I anticipate a similar trend with the AI group.\"",

      "text": "\"Loud luxury\" is poised for a comeback as ailing fashion houses attempt to inject a sense of newness and novelty into their designs to win over weary shoppers.\n\nA flurry of new creative directors at brands including Gucci, Chanel and Versace, and the arrival of new Kering CEO Luca de Meo , are seen phasing out \"quiet luxury\" subtlety in favor of statement styles, in what analysts say could be a turning point for the industry.\n\n\"We are seeing a shift to a bit more visible luxury at the moment,\" Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last month.\n\n\"Luxury fashion is a cycle. Now, with quiet luxury being a few years old, you want something else. Back to my novelty, newness thesis: I think this is now the focus.\"\n\nThe sartorial shake-up comes as the luxury sector struggles to overcome a series of headwinds, from trade tariffs to soft consumer sentiment, following its Covid-era boom.\n\nUltra-luxe brands Brunello Cucinelli , Hermes and LVMH 's Loro Piana have navigated that downturn largely unscathed, as their super-rich clientele continued to spend big on understated couture cashmere and high-end handbags.\n\nBut for many brands, quiet luxury's discrete opulence , which glided to the fore in 2022 alongside the popularity of shows like HBO's \"Succession,\" no longer cut it. That could herald a new era of large logos, bold branding and distinctive designs dominating catwalks to high streets.\n\n\"There is no longer the same level of desire for many products across the market, pushing all major brands to change creative direction in search of relevance,\" Yanmei Tang, analyst at\u00a0Third Bridge, said via email.\n\nOne brand owning that shift is Burberry . Under the leadership of CEO Josh Schulman, the company is once again embracing its British heritage image after years of management changes, declining sales and knock-off dupes sullying associations with its eponymous check print and signature trench .\n\nChief Financial Officer Kate Ferry said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company's statement heritage collection, which includes full checkered two-pieces, was \"reigniting brand desire\" and positioning Burberry among a wide consumer base as \"a luxury brand with broad universal appeal.\"\n\nGucci is seen targeting the same refit under its new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, whose boundary-pushing designs courted controversy at parent company Kering's smaller Balenciaga label.\n\nKering 's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said last week that a \"first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci\" would come in September, with a full rollout of the collection due in early 2026.\n\nFashionistas and investors have long awaited a catalyst to turn around Gucci's fortunes, as sales have suffered , particularly from weaker demand in China. The arrival next month of former Renault chief Luca de Meo as Kering CEO is also set to inject an outsider perspective and branding expertise.\n\n\"The key thing is to bring back some brand desirability,\" Madjo said. \"Bringing newness \u2014 something fresh which has not been seen before \u2014 is, I think, what could make Gucci great again.\"\n\nNew creative and artistic leads are also seen shaking things up at Chanel, Bottega Veneta and the famously out-there Versace. Moncler , meanwhile, has opted to experiment with rotating designers via its Genius collection, and Prada recently cited image adaptability among the brand's virtues.\n\n\"What's beautiful about Prada is that it can be sporty, it can be glamorous. This is one of the few brands that can allow us to play three or four games at the same time,\" group CEO Andrea Guerra said on an earnings call last month.\n\nFashion houses will be hoping that the image overhauls can help inspire waning interest from consumers who became disillusioned with brands after significant pandemic-era price hikes failed to reflect product innovation.\n\nAccording to UBS's Evidence Lab, the price of luxury goods rose by a record 8% on average in 2022, well above the pre-Covid rate of 1% and the 3% recorded this year to May.\n\nOnly top-end brands Hermes, Rolex and Richemont -owned Cartier have been able to sustain significant price rises in 2025 \u2014 though many more have warned that tariffs may force their hand . Gucci, Burberry and Prada, meanwhile, have raised prices, but to a smaller extent.\n\nThat's likely to propel a further divide between quiet ultra-luxe brands and relatively more affordable labels.\n\nMarcus Morris, portfolio manager for European and global growth equities at Alliance Bernstein, told CNBC last week that higher prices could now only be justified by the \"right brands, the right brand management and the right marketing of those brands.\"\n\nNevertheless, more modest pricing strategies may be what's needed for troubled brands seeking to regain market share and compel a broader consumer base.\n\n\"High-end soft luxury brands have increased their prices a lot,\" Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at\u00a0Bernstein, told CNBC. \"Brands with a more moderate pricing approach [are] doing well ... potentially going to benefit from this middle ground.\"\n\nIndeed, in a loud luxury era, it could play in their favor.\n\n\"It could be less of an issue to show off this product, because it is still a bit more affordable, let's say, compared to some other brands,\" Madjo said.\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the spellings of Bottega Veneta and Loro Piana.",

Nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices are using long-term incentive compensation, according to the report.\n\nWhile family offices have often given special performance bonuses to executives, the awards are becoming far more structured, clear and generous.\n\n\"Over time, we are seeing an increased formalization of compensation plans,\" said Valerie Wong Fountain, managing director and head of family office resources and partner management at Morgan Stanley. \"If you go back a number of years, you may have seen more handshake agreements.

Larger investment-focused family offices, with over $1 billion in assets, are paying a median of over $1.2 million. Soaring pay at the very top of investment-focused firms has pushed average pay for $1 billion-plus CEOs to over $3 million a year, according to the report.\n\nChief investment officers, or CIOs, are also benefiting. Median pay for investment-focused CIOs is now $900,000, with the average at $1.8 million.\n\nThe incentive plans are also changing. Co-investments are becoming especially popular, allowing executives to invest alongside the family in deals. Since wealthy families often get special access to fas-growing companies and coveted deals, the opportunity to invest alongside the family is an added bonus.

      "text": "Gucci-owner Kering on Tuesday posted worse-than-feared second-quarter results and flagged ongoing geopolitical uncertainty as woes persist at the beleaguered luxury group.\n\nSales at the high-end fashion house dropped 15% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 3.7 billion euros ($4.27 billion), compared to the 3.96 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts.\n\nGucci sales, which typically make up nearly half of total group revenues,\u00a0plunged 25% over the quarter to 1.46 billion euros.\n\nChairman and CEO Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault acknowledged the results as disappointing, but noted ongoing efforts to course correct the struggling luxury giant.\n\n\"Though the numbers we are reporting remain well below our potential, we are certain that our comprehensive efforts of the past two years have set healthy foundations for the next stages in Kering's development,\" Pinault said in a statement accompanying the results.\n\n\"In an economic and geopolitical environment that remains uncertain, Kering continues to deploy its strategy with the aim of achieving a profitable long-term growth trajectory,\" the company added.\n\nThe group, which also owns the Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands, said sales were weaker across all markets, led by Japan and the wider Asia Pacific.\n\n\"Kering is facing a tough reality as its two main luxury markets, China and the United States, are under strain,\" Yanmei Tang, analyst at\u00a0Third Bridge, said in emailed comments shortly after the earnings release.\n\nKering's share price is currently down 8% year-to-date as investors have questioned the company's ability to turn itself around after several consecutive quarters of soft sales.\n\nThe appointment in June of auto veteran\u00a0Luca de Meo as group CEO brought positive momentum, with his appointment set to take effect from Sept. 15.\n\n\"[De Meo] has a really strong track record in turning around businesses but also in branding,\" Carole Madjo, head of European luxury goods research at Barclays, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week.\n\nThe incoming CEO nevertheless has a tough task ahead of him, as the industry faces the prospect of new 15% tariffs on imports to the U.S. as well as broader concerns around consumer spending, particularly in the key Chinese market.\n\nChief financial officer Armelle Poulou\u00a0said Tuesday that the 15% tariff rate was in line with assumptions and would be \"manageable through pricing adjustments,\" adding that the company had already implemented some price hikes in the second quarter.\n\n\"We may consider a second wave in the autumn,\" Poulou\u00a0told an earnings call. \"[But] we will make sure we are applying it in a smart way, mindful of consumer sentiment.\"\n\nStill, analysts suggest the bigger challenge will be reviving the company's image and desirability, including under Gucci's new artistic director Demna Gvasalia, while simultaneously not alienating existing consumers.\n\nKering's deputy CEO and brand development lead, Francesca Bellettini, said that a \"first hint of [Demna's] vision for Gucci\" would come in September, with full roll out of the collection due in early 2026.\n\n\"Product desirability is now a bigger problem for Kering than any tariff threat,\" Tang said. \"Desirable brands like Herm\u00e8s can nudge prices higher without hurting demand, but brands such as Saint Laurent and Gucci do not currently enjoy that level of pricing power.\"\n\n\"Bringing newness, something fresh which has not been seen before, is, I think, what could make Gucci great again,\" Madjo added.",

      "text": "An investment group led by LVMH's private equity arm is buying 20% of private jet company Flexjet, marking the latest push by the luxury industry to expand into travel.\n\nL Catterton, the private equity firm backed by French luxury giant LVMH, is leading an $800 million investment in Flexjet that will also include brand partnerships and collaborations. The investment group also includes affiliates of KSL Capital Partners and the J. Safra Group. Flexjet will continue to be controlled by parent company Directional Aviation Capital.\n\nThe deal highlights the luxury industry's rapid expansion into the experience economy as wealthy consumers increase their spending on travel, dining and special events. LVMH acquired hospitality group Belmond in 2018 for $3.2 billion, and has been building out its Cheval Blanc and Bulgari hotel and resort brands.\n\nGlobal sales of luxury goods declined 2% last year to 363 billion euros ($424 billion) as demand from Gen Z and Chinese consumers fell, according to a report from Bain and Altagamma. Luxury hospitality, however, grew by 4%, while gourmet food and fine dining surged 8% and sales of yachts and private jets increased 13%.\n\nFor Cleveland-based Flexjet, the deal creates a relationship with the world's largest luxury giant and its portfolio of more than 75 coveted brands, from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Dom Perignon and Tiffany.\n\nWith the private jet industry becoming increasingly competitive and dominated by industry leader NetJets, Flexjet aims to be more like an exclusive membership club, offering luxury experiences and bespoke services. Flexjet already has partnerships with Belmond, yacht maker Ferretti Group and Bentley Motors, collaborating on jet interiors and curated events.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\n\"We have been trying to move Flexjet into an experiential role,\" said Kenn Ricci, chairman of Flexjet and principal of Directional Aviation. \"If you think about luxury travel and where it is today, I keep thinking about a Flexjet community. When you have an experience at a hotel, you get to have it for a week, and you get to know what that experience is. But when you fly on a jet, it happens four hours, five hours. So how do we create that Flexjet community?\"\n\nRicci said most of the proceeds of the deal will go to expanding and improving Flexjet's infrastructure. That includes buying larger, long-range planes to fill rapidly growing demand for international travel. The company will also build up its infrastructure overseas, with added maintenance facilities and ground handling. And Flexjet will continue adding and training flight crews through its special cabin attendant academy. About 25% of the proceeds will be used to pay a special dividend to shareholders.\n\nRicci said Flexjet is projecting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $425 million this year, up from $398 million in 2024 and more than double the levels in 2020. The company offers fractional ownership and leasing options, as well as jet cards. Its fleet of 318 aircraft is expected to reach 340 by the end of 2025, and it has more than 2,000 Flexjet members under the fractional and leasing program, according to the company.\n\nRicci said L Catterton approached Flexjet with the potential deal as the private equity firm seeks to stay ahead of the changing definitions of luxury among the wealthy.\n\n\"(L Catterton) presented us some ideas about where they see the future of luxury,\" Ricci said. \"They basically see that the luxury of the future is time. And they see that in private travel, you can recoup time.\"\n\nRicci said the details of potential brand partnerships or collaborations have yet to be announced. But he cited as a model Flexjet's partnership with Belmond, which includes special deals and enhanced stays at the company's luxury hotels in Venice and Ravello, Italy; and Mallorca, Spain, as well as other locations.\n\nHe said the company's bespoke aircraft cabins, modeled after individually designed rooms at the best hotels, would also continue to be a competitive advantage.\n\n\"When faced with a behemoth like NetJets, we don't need to be the largest,\" he said. \"We want to be the boutique.\"\n\nL Catterton is 40% owned by LVMH and the family office of CEO Bernard Arnault. It manages $37 billion in equity capital across consumer brands including Birkenstock , Thorne and Etro.\n\nScott Dahnke, global CEO of L Catterton, said in a statement that Flexjet's history \"is one of never settling in pursuit of thoughtful innovation to best fulfill the desires of the consumers within their unique and exciting marketplace.\"",

      "text": "Italian luxury house Moncler said it's currently relying on \"very slight price increases\" to offset the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, but warned that broader economic weakness could cause it to delay its new store openings next year.\n\nThe Milan-headquartered retailer said Wednesday that it had raised prices by \"mid-single-digit\" percentages for the second half of 2025 and will raise them for the first half of next year, while adding that it was awaiting further clarity on U.S. levies before setting out its full strategy for 2026.\n\n\"We normally finalize our pricing strategy for the full Winter 2026 by October, more or less. So it's still early,\" Luciano Santel, group chief corporate and supply officer, said during an earnings call accompanying its second-quarter results.\n\nShares of Moncler were down 4% by 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. E.T.).\n\nChief Business Strategy and Global Market Officer Roberto Eggs said he intended for those further price rises to be \"more conservative,\" as the firm seeks to reconcile higher input costs with customer retention, but noted that it was also dependent on macro trends and currency movements.\n\n\"Clearly, the pricing today for consumers is a concern. I think we need to pay even more attention on this,\" he said.\n\nEggs also noted that the business would remain flexible on its plans for a dozen or so new store openings etched for 2026, based on the macro outlook and wider recovery of the beleaguered luxury sector.\n\n\"For the plan 2025, it's already there. Regarding 2026, the plan is not completely finalized, so we have some flexibility, ... in case things will not get better, to postpone some of the openings,\" he said, adding that those plans would also be set by October.\n\nMoncler on Wednesday posted a dip in second-quarter sales after the market close, as weak tourist flows weighed on otherwise robust domestic demand in the key U.S. and China markets.\n\nGroup revenues fell 1% year-on-year at constant exchange rates to 396.6 million euros ($536.7 million) in the three months to June 30, below the 427.2 million forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.\n\nThe U.S., which accounts for 14% of Moncler brand sales, recorded a 5% sales uptick in the quarter, but the company said it was unclear whether that was driven by shoppers accelerating purchases ahead of the ramping up of tariffs.\n\n\"To tell you that if this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you,\" Eggs said, noting other initiatives, such as a partnership with luxury department store Nordstom, which helped boost demand.\n\nSales in Asia, the group's largest market, were flat on the quarter, while in Europe, the Middle East and Africa they declined 8%. The company attributed it to a rebalancing of the Japanese yen, with Japan the only Asian country to record negative sales growth, as well as soft tourist spending in Europe.",

But now brands are battling a rebalancing.\n\nRichemont saw sales in Japan drop 15% year-on-year in the three months to June, following a 59% jump over the same period the year prior. Burberry also cited a \"challenging performance\" in Japan in the second quarter, and Moncler said Japan was its only negative-performing Asia market \u2014 both without providing specific figures.\n\nSome firms noted, however, that a downturn in tourism to Japan \u2014 and to a lesser extent Europe \u2014 has resulted in an uptick in domestic spending in certain other markets.\n\n\"[In China] we have seen tangible improvement locally,\" said LVMH's Chief Financial Officer C\u00e9cile Cabanis during an earnings call Thursday, citing a \"repatriation from the big drop we've seen in tourism to Japan.\"\n\nSeveral luxury firms have also pointed to a strengthening of U.S. sales in the second quarter, even as consumers wait with bated breath for the impact of tariffs.\n\nBurberry , Richemont, Moncler and Brunello Cucinelli all reported increased sales in their American markets over the second quarter, while LVMH noted that American demand was \"broadly unchanged.\"\n\nStill, the extent to which that uptick is driven by U.S. customers frontloading purchases ahead of the full onset of tariffs is not yet clear, according to the firms.\n\n\"To tell you that this was driven by an anticipation of buying links to the tariffs? Honestly, I cannot tell you,\" Roberto Eggs, Moncler's chief business strategy and global market officer, said on an earnings call Wednesday.\n\nLuxury companies have also been honing in on the U.S. market in recent quarters in a bid to compensate for continued soft demand in the key Chinese market.\n\nBurberry CEO Joshua Schulman said the company's recent U.S. growth indicated the \"diversity of the luxury consumer that exists in that market,\" from elite, high-spenders to high-traffic mall shoppers.\n\nU.S. tariffs are nonetheless weighing on the outlook for most European luxury houses, who rely heavily on localized production as part of their cache.\n\nAs such, many have suggested that they will need to raise prices in the coming quarters to offset added costs.\n\nBrunello Cucinelli flagged price hikes of 3% to 4% in the U.S. while Moncler said it was implementing \"mid-single-digit\" percentage increases for the coming 12 months. Burberry, meanwhile, said it began adjusting prices last year as part of broader overhaul plans.\n\nLVMH, on the other hand, said Thursday that prices rises would need to come with an \"improvement in the product\" or modest rebalancing around inflation.\n\nHowever, the French luxury conglomerate then went on to cite price hikes among \"several levers\" at its disposal to counter the impact of tariffs.\n\nIt comes as the cost of luxury goods has risen by an average of 3% so far this year \u2014 the slowest pace since 2019 \u2014 according to UBS' evidence lab, as brands have sought to reconcile consumer retention with higher input costs following a Covid-era surge in prices.\n\nFinally, category mix remains a fundamental factor in the divided luxury picture, with brand appeal playing as much of a role as the product type itself.\n\nJewelry remains a winning play for Cartier-owner Richemont, even as high-end watches \u2014 both its own and those of other luxury watchmakers \u2014 remain a weak point.\n\nTiffany-owner LVMH, however, continues to battle softness in its jewelry and fashion and leather goods maisons, despite leather handbags going from strength to strength for ultra-luxe brand Hermes.\n\nCarole Madjo, Barclays' head of European luxury goods research, told CNBC that she expects leather goods dominance to continue to play out when Hermes reports on Wednesday.\n\n\"[Hermes] is always very good, thanks to leather goods mostly,\" she told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, investors will be eagerly awaiting more color on Tuesday from Gucci-owner Kering on its product overhaul under artistic director Demna Gvasalia and incoming CEO Luca de Meo.\n\n\"Bringing newness, something fresh which has not been seen before, is I think what could make Gucci great again,\" Madjo said.",

For decades, the art market has been driven largely by baby boomers who built large art collections as their wealth grew throughout the 1980s, '90s and 2000s. Many of those baby boomer collectors are now buying less or downsizing. And a growing number are leaving estates with large collections to sell, since their kids often don't want the art.\n\nAt the same time, the new generation of wealthy \u2014 millennials and Gen Z \u2014 grew up in a more digital world and may not have the same tastes or interest in the paintings of 20th century artists. With over $100 trillion in wealth expected to pass mainly from baby boomers to the next generation, some experts say the art market may be showing signs of structural change and a more existential crisis.\n\nThe auction houses are racing to adapt with more online sales, luxury items and lower-priced offerings. Auction sales in the luxury category \u2014 including jewelry, handbags, wine, watches and sports memorabilia \u2014 grew 1% in the first half even as art sales declined, according to ArtTactic.\n\nJewelry is shining especially bright among young, female collectors as more wealth shifts to women . Jewel and jewelry sales jumped 68% in the first half compared to a year ago. Online auctions are also rapidly gaining share over physical auctions as younger collectors prefer to bid from their phones.\n\nTotal auction sales at Christie's were stable in the first half, thanks in large part to online sales and luxury. Its luxury sales, which also included classic cars, surged 29% to $468 million. Among the highlights: the Marie-Therese Pink Diamond, said to have belonged to Marie Antoinette, which sold for $14 million, and the \"Blue Belle\" fancy vivid blue diamond went for $11 million.\n\nThe shine from jewelry and luxury goods is also helping Sotheby's, which sold its own blue diamond, the famed \"Mediterranean Blue,\" for $21.5 million in May after a fierce bidding war.\n\nYounger collectors are driving strong demand for collectibles priced under $100,000, with the most competitive bidding for works under $50,000. \u00a0The top end of the art market, with lots priced at over $10 million, plunged 39% last year, while sales of works for less than $5,000 jumped 13%, according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report.\n\nBonnie Brennan , CEO of Christie's, told reporters that the auction's house's chief mission is to offer the objects that its clients want today, and offer them at the right price \u2014 especially for the new generation of collectors. Fully 80% of its bids this year have been online and nearly a third of winning bids came from millennial or Gen Z buyers.\n\n\"We are showing great relevance to the younger generation, to millennials, to Gen Z,\" Brennan said. \"It's something that's really critical to sustain our business going forward.\"",

      "text": "American shoppers are buying into the allure of British heritage fashion, providing a glimmer of hope for beleaguered Burberry 's turnaround even as U.S. headwinds loom.\n\nBurberry sales in the Americas rose 4% year-on-year in the three months to June 28, the company said Friday in its fiscal first-quarter results.\n\nShares of Burberry were up 8.13% by 11:26 a.m. London time (6:26 a.m. E.T.).\n\nThe luxury brand, known for its trench coats, attributed the uptick to both new and existing consumers, following a 4% decline in the region in the fourth-quarter and a 9% fall in Burberry's full 2025 fiscal year.\n\nCEO Joshua Schulman said the growth indicated the \"diversity of the luxury consumer that exists in that market,\" from elite, high-spenders to high-traffic mall shoppers. The U.S. accounts for 19% of Burberry's business.\n\nNevertheless, Schulman said that Burberry's efforts to position itself as a \"luxury brand with broad universal appeal\" was showing green shoots in other regions, too.\n\nBurberry's overall group revenues declined 1% year-on-year on a comparable basis to \u00a3433 million ($ 582million) in the June quarter, compared with the 3% decline analysts had forecast in a company compiled consensus.\n\nSales rose 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa (EMEIA) in the June quarter, while declining 5% in the Greater China region and by 4% in Asia Pacific, which the company said was \" driven by Japan following a slowdown in tourism.\"\n\nAll regions nevertheless demonstrated notable improvements from significant declines in prior quarters.\n\n\"What we saw in the Americas, we also saw in the other regions as well. Our local customer has been strong globally and we have seen a sequential improvement in all regions,\" Schulman told a media call on Friday.\n\nThe results fall against a troubling backdrop for the luxury sector, as U.S. tariffs loom large, threatening to undermine an anticipated revival in U.S. consumer spending, even as the Chinese market continues to lag.\n\nBurberry's Chief Financial Officer Kate Ferry acknowledged the tariffs as a \"headwind,\" but said that the company had spent the previous year adapting its supply chains and adjusting pricing where appropriate.\n\n\"We actually took a very surgical approach to pricing in the U.S. and understood where we had price elasticity,\" she said on the Friday earnings call.\n\nIt comes amid a sweeping overhaul of the 169-year-old heritage luxury fashion house. On Friday, it that said a previously announced cost savings program, including 1,700 job cuts announced in May, would results in \u00a380 million in annualized savings by the end of the 2026 financial year.\n\nJuly marks the first anniversary at the helm for Schulman, who joined from Michael Kors and in November announced urgent plans to \"course correct\" after a prolonged period of the company's share price underperformance, waning sales and a slew of management changes.\n\nUBS analysts said in a note Friday that the results provided confidence that Burberry's brand momentum was \"accelerating.\"\n\n\"Josh got in at the eleventh hour to try and steer the Spring/Summer product in the right direction with this focus on Britishness and on iconic Burberry products, the check pattern, more realistic pricing,\" Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at Bernstein, sector told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday.\n\n\"The fact that organic growth is improving, while being still negative, I think is a sign that the new marketing vision works. We expect even more good news in the second half when the full winter product is going to fully represent the new marketing approach and that means a lot to investors, clearly.\"",

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nThe new federal spending bill is expected to boost sales of private jets, as owners take advantage of faster write-offs of the purchase price.\n\nJet brokers and advisors said they've seen a burst of activity from clients who were holding off on purchases until the bill was signed. Among its many new tax provisions is the reinstatement of \"bonus depreciation,\" which allows businesses to immediately write off 100% of the purchase price of capital equipment, including private jets.\n\nIndividuals, who typically own a jet through their private business or holding company, can now write off the entire cost of a new or used jet in the first year of ownership for any plane placed into service in or after Jan. 19, 2025.\n\nThe tax benefit only applies to business jets, not jets used for personal use. It revives a provision of the 2017 tax cuts and replaces the current phased-out depreciation percentages of 60% in 2024 and 40% in 2025.\n\n\"We've had a number of owners who were looking to upgrade and have been waiting for this,\" said Barry Shevlin, CEO of FlyUSA, the aviation solutions company. \"And I have at least a half-dozen others who are looking to buy after this was passed.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nThe tax stimulus comes at just the right time for the private jet industry, which has seen a slowdown in growth from its feverish pitch in 2020 and 2021. The industry saw a surge in new owners, charter fliers and fractional owners after Covid, but many of the wealthy who bought planes then for the first time have started selling them or moving to fractional ownership due to higher-than expected maintenance and pilot costs.\n\nThe number of pre-owned business jets for sale increased to an average monthly rate of over 1,800 in the first half, according to JetNet. That's up from 1,744 in the first half of 2024. The average time on market has also increased, to 418 days from 386 days, the data firm said.\n\n\"During Covid, a lot of the people who bought planes didn't know what they were getting into,\" Shevlin said. \"They were shocked by what it cost and what it involved.\"\n\nPhilip Rushton, founder and president of Aviatrade, said there are now around 23 to 25 Gulfstream G650ERs on the market, which is slightly higher than usual.\n\n\"It's certainly normalized after Covid,\" he said.\n\nThe big rush to buy private jets, however, may not start until the fall. Brokers said private jet purchases typically spike at the end of the year, when companies and individuals are finalizing their tax bills.\n\nMatt Walter, managing partner at Guardian Jet, said the ultra-wealthy won't decide to buy a plane just because of a tax change. \"But it certainly helps that decision,\" he said. \"If you planned to upgrade your plane in 12 months, maybe you do it in six months instead.\"\n\nHe said he's advising clients to buy before September but sell after September, because demand will likely surge in the fall.\n\n\"You want to buy before it gets crazy,\" he said. \"After September, you're going to be competing with other buyers and also competing for inspection slots. In a heated market, everyone is going to be trying to do the same thing and trying to find inspection slots.\"",

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani's primary win in New York City's mayoral race and proposal to raise taxes on millionaires have touched off fears of a new wave of wealth flight from the city. Yet so far, there is little evidence of a slowdown in high-end real estate or real wealth losses in New York.\n\nFlorida real estate brokers say they've seen a surge in inquiries from the New York wealthy looking to move to Miami or Palm Beach. Business owners are threatening to leave the city or close. And New York developers, caught in the crosshairs of Mamdani's rent control platform, have banded together to fund Mamdani's opponents in the November general election.\n\nAt the center of the economic concern is Mamdani's so-called \"millionaire tax.\" He's proposed an additional 2% tax on New Yorkers earning more than $1 million a year. Added to the city's current top rate of 3.876%, the tax would bring the combined New York City and state tax to 16.776%, by far the highest in the country. The combined federal, state and city rate would be 53.776%.\n\nAnd New York's high earners won't have to go to Florida to avoid the tax. They can simply move to neighboring Long Island or Westchester County or even New Jersey. Unlike New York state, New York City can't tax people who work in the city but have their primary residence elsewhere.\n\n\"New York City can only tax its own residents,\" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation. \"A high earner doesn't need to give up the convenience of the city, they just need to move outside the five boroughs. Migration across city lines is the easiest.\"\n\nImportantly, Mamdani wouldn't be able to raise income taxes. The city's income tax rates are set by Albany, where Gov. Kathy Hochul has said she will block any tax hike. \"I don't want to lose any more people to Palm Beach,\" Hochul told the New York Post.\n\nCritics also fear Mamdani's policies toward the police and public safety could make the city even more dangerous, becoming the final straw for many business owners and top earners who were already considering leaving. The top 1% of New Yorkers pay over 40% of the income taxes, so losing even a small number of high earners would set off a downward spiral of lower revenue and lower services and more out-migration.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nNew York state had a net loss of $14 billion in net adjusted income due to taxpayers leaving between 2021 and 2022, according to the Tax Foundation and IRS data. The city's revenue from personal income taxes declined between 2022 and 2024, from $16.7 billion in 2022 to $14 billion last year \u2014 although they're still above the pre-Covid levels of $13.4 billion in 2019, according to data from the New York City comptroller.\n\nAt the same time, however, there are signs that New York's powerful wealth machine is constantly replenishing the ranks of millionaires and billionaires, more than making up for the rich who move out. The number of millionaires in New York City has more than doubled over the past decade \u2014 despite the Covid losses \u2014 to over 2.4 million, according to Altrata. There are now over 33,000 New Yorkers worth $30 million or more, nearly double that of Miami, according to Altrata. Whether it's measuring millionaires, multi-millionaires or billionaires, New York City has maintained its dominance as the richest wealth hub in the world.\n\n\"New York remains a powerful magnet for the wealthy, offering a blend of luxury consumption, vibrant culture, high-quality education and lifestyle cachet, with the borough of Manhattan the epicenter of ultra-prime real estate,\" said a report from Altrata and REALM.\n\nDemand for pricey luxury apartments in New York also shows no signs of slowing, even after Mamdani's win in the June 24 primary. There were 64 contracts signed between June 23 and July 13 for apartments priced over $4 million, up 13% over last year, with a sales total of more more than $555 million in sales, according to Olshan Realty. Among the signed contracts was a $35 million, three-bedroom spread on Fifth Avenue that was first listed in December.\n\n\"The luxury market is on pace for one of its best years,\" said Donna Olshan, of Olshan Realty, who also cautioned that any potential Mamdani-related weakness could show up in the Fall.\n\nNot only did New York's millionaire and billionaire population rebound quickly after Covid, but high earners also bounced back. While the city lost a net 5,000 households earning $1 million or more during the pandemic, their ranks have grown from 30,400 in 2019 to 34,127 in 2022, the latest period available, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.\n\nNathan Gusdorf, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, said the narrative of wealth flight from New York is fed in part by the media, which highlights a small number of high-profile billionaires who move from New York to Florida. Stories about billionaires like Josh Harris, Carl Icahn and Daniel Och decamping to Florida ignores the broader ebb and flow of wealth in New York. New York's powerful economy, fueled by the financial services industry, continues to produce more new millionaires than it loses.\n\n\"We do not have a fixed population of millionaires that just declines whenever one of them leaves,\" Gusdorf said. \"The city regenerates that lost millionaire population.\"\n\nEven if Mamdani were to win the mayorship in November and raise taxes, the direct impact on wealth flight may be more limited than many expect. According to the Fiscal Policy Center's latest research, the top 1% of New Yorkers by income (those making more than $800,000 a year) leave the city at one quarter the rate of all other income groups. When the New York wealthy do move, they have most often oved to other high-tax states like New Jersey, Connecticut or California \u2013 suggesting lifestyle rather than taxes are the driver.\n\n\"There is a strong indication that higher tax rates at the state level imposed on the top earners are not having real behavioral effects,\" Gusdorf said.\n\nOthers, however, say taxes have outsized importance for the wealthy, proven by the sweeping population moves in recent years from high-tax to low- or no-tax states like Florida and Texas.\n\nA study by the California Center for Jobs and the Economy described a \"taxodus,\" or net loss of $5.3 billion in personal income tax, from high earners who left after a 2016 extension of higher taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\"High tax rates do lead to outmigration and lower income growth,\" Walczak said.",

      "summary": "Taxpayers earning $1 million or more are expected to see a boost in after-tax income of about 3% under Trump's megabill.",
      "text": "The wealthy will likely see a host of new tax breaks in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" along with permanent extensions of many of the 2017 tax cuts, according to tax experts.\n\nTaxpayers earning $1 million or more are expected to see a boost in after-tax income of about 3% in the Senate version of Trump\u2019s bill, according to the Tax Policy Center. That compares with the nationwide average of about 2.5%. In dollar terms, millionaire earners will see an average after-tax income increase of $75,000 in 2026, according to the Tax Policy Center .\n\nVirtually all the core provisions of the 2017 tax cut are expected to be extended in the final bill, which was passed in the House on Thursday and now heads to Trump's desk, with some provisions becoming permanent. There are also several new tax breaks or benefits added in the bill that further lower tax bills for those at the top \u2014 especially for investors in small businesses.\n\nHere are the five most important changes in the bill that affect high earners and the wealthy.\n\nSurprisingly, the Senate bill largely follows the House's version of the state and local tax, or SALT, cap increase. The existing $10,000 cap on SALT deductions will rise to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000, with the income threshold rising 1% a year. Initially the Senate was opposed to a change that largely benefits blue-state top earners. Yet after threats from the House, the Senate agreed to the $40,000 level.\n\nUnlike the original House version of SALT, however, the Senate bill preserves a popular loophole to get around the cap. Dozens of states allow a workaround, called the pass-through entity tax, or PTET, that encourages pass-through owners and partners to avoid the cap at the state level. It benefits everyone from car dealers and dentists to accounting and law partners, but not employees of those firms.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nThe initial House version of the bill eliminated the loophole benefit for service industries and most white-collar firms, such as accountants, lawyers and doctors, according to Kyle Pomerleau at the American Enterprise Institute. Yet the Senate didn\u2019t follow the House change.\n\n\u201cThe Senate version has no limitation on the workarounds,\u201d Pomerleau said, \u201ceffectively allowing these taxpayers to utilize an unlimited SALT deduction.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors in small businesses will cheer a change in qualified small business stock, or QSBS. Created during the Clinton administration and expanded under President Barack Obama, the program is designed to encourage investments and creation of small companies. Under current law, investors or owners of a qualifying C Corp for more than five years get reductions in capital gains taxes when they sell. A qualifying company is defined as a \u201csmall business\u201d if its total assets are $50 million or less. When a business is sold, owners or investors are exempt from capital gains taxes up to $10 million, or 10 times the original basis of the investment, whichever is greater.\n\nThe Senate bill raises the threshold to qualify as a \u201csmall business\u201d from $50 million to $75 million. It also increases the exclusion from $10 million to $15 million, and it creates a new, tiered system for allowing tax breaks for those who want to sell before five years.\n\nJustin Miller, partner and national director of wealth planning at Evercore, said the new rules would allow an investor to put $74.9 million into a small business and have up to $749 million exempt from capital gains if it sold for more than 10 times the original basis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging wealthy investors in qualified small businesses with enormous potential,\u201d Miller said.\n\nLike the version the House put forward, the Senate bill makes the estate tax permanent, which in Washington means it won\u2019t have a built-in expiration date. The exemption would increase to $15 million per estate or $30 million for couples, and the exemption will be indexed for inflation.\n\nFor the ultra-wealthy, the estate tax is the most important of all the major tax code provisions. So having some stability, at least until the next election, will make for calmer estate planning and gifts.\n\nThe Senate bill includes a limit on the value of itemized deductions that was also included in the original House bill. Only about 10% of Americans \u2014 mostly the wealthy \u2014 still itemize their taxes, since the standard deduction is now $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Under both the House and Senate versions, taxpayers in the top bracket will have to subtract 2/37th from the value of each dollar deducted over the threshold. The net effect is that top taxpayers will only get a deduction benefit of 35 cents for every dollar, rather than 37 cents.\n\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news for charitable giving, depending on your income level. For lower- and middle-income earners, the Senate bill includes a provision to encourage more charitable giving by the 90% of Americans who no longer itemize. The 2017 tax cuts doubled the standard deduction, eliminating the incentive for the vast majority of taxpayers to itemize and claim the charitable deduction. The Senate bill allows taxpayers to take the standard deduction and still claim a charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married joint filers.\n\nYet for wealthy donors, who now account for the majority of charitable giving, the Senate bill is decidedly uncharitable.

      "text": "The rich and famous have descended on Venice, Italy this weekend to celebrate the wedding of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former broadcast journalist Lauren Sanchez in a show of all things money.\n\nThe star-studded event boasts a guestlist of some 200 celebrities and business elite, including President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Usher and a spattering of the Kardashians \u2014 to name a but few.\n\nAnd while the exact details of the three-day affair have been kept confidential amid city-wide protests, it is expected to rack up a bill of around $50 million.\n\nThe couple will reportedly exchange their vows Friday at a black-tie ceremony on the private island of San Giorgio, away from public access, according to the Guardian.\n\nThe main wedding reception, meanwhile, is set to be held Saturday in the Arsenale, a historic complex surrounded by fortified walls on the eastern side of the city. The venue was changed at the last minute from a 16th-century building in the center of the city due to security concerns.\n\nIt follows a pre-wedding reception Thursday, which was held in the cloisters of Madonna dell'Orto,\u00a0a medieval church in the central area of Cannaregio.\n\nOther side events are reportedly set to include a foam party and a Great Gatsby-themed soiree.\n\nThe president of the Veneto regional government which comprises Venice, Luca Zaia, told reporters Tuesday that the wedding and its various accompaniments were set to cost 40 million to 48 million euros ($47-$56 million).\n\nBezos, one of the world's richest people with an estimated net worth of $230 billion, according to Forbes, is also reportedly set to make a number of charity donations, including 2 million euros for\u00a0Corila, an academic consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem.\n\nThe expense doesn't stop there, however: many guests arrived early \u2014 via private jet, super yacht and helicopter \u2014 to enjoy the best designer shopping and high-end hotels the city of water has to offer.\n\nFive of Venice's most luxurious hotels, including the Cipriani and the Aman, have been booked out to host the guests, according to Reuters.\n\nThe lavish display of money and excess has provoked backlash from local residents and environmental demonstrators who protest the use of the Unesco world heritage site as a playground for the super-rich.\n\nVenice has already been under pressure from over tourism, with the famed Italian city last year becoming the first in the world to introduce a tourist entry fee in a bid to alleviate the pressure of mass tourism and make it more livable for residents.\n\nItaly has, nevertheless, been experiencing a surge in wealthy arrivals \u2014 both to visit and live \u2014 as its more hospitable flat-tax regime and booming luxury real estate sector have proved a draw whereas other countries have sought to crack down on the uber-rich .",

In June of that year, the Japanese currency weakened to 38-year lows , crossing the 161 mark against the dollar.\n\nRichemont, whose brands also include Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati, benefitted from that weakness throughout last year, reporting 20% to 25% sales growth in Japan over consecutive quarters.\n\nIt was not alone.

      "text": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's $5 million Trump Card has attracted strong interest from the overseas wealthy, but it faces legal challenges and questions about the potential market size, according to immigration attorneys.\n\nTrump launched the website in June for his new immigration plan, first called \"the Gold Card\" and then renamed \"the Trump Card.\" A brief questionnaire asked interested parties for their name, email, region and whether the Trump Card would be for \"self,\" \"family,\" \"spouse\" or \"other,\" as well as whether the application came from a business or individual.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the Financial Times that 70,000 people had already signed up and that the card would be made from real gold. In March he said the potential market for the cards was 37 million. He said selling 200,000 cards would net $1 trillion for the Treasury and help pay down the federal debt.\n\nThe Trump Card has energized the burgeoning market for investment or \"golden\" visas, which allow the wealthy to buy residency or citizenship in another country in exchange for a six-figure or seven-figure investment. A record 142,000 millionaires will move to another country this year, according to Henley & Partners, driven by rising political turmoil and unrest. The U.K. is expected to lose a net 16,500 millionaires due to a change in its tax program, according to Henley. The UAE, the biggest gainer, is set to add a net 9,800 millionaires while the U.S. is expected to gain a net 7,500.\n\nThe Trump Card would also arrive as many countries once favored by the wealthy \u2014 including Spain, Portugal and Italy \u2014 are tightening their investment-visa programs amid populist opposition and political backlash.\n\nYet in interviews with immigration attorneys, advisors to the wealthy and political staffers involved in the program, they said the Trump Card faces fundamental legal and tax obstacles. What's more, even if it's approved and eventually offered, the number of buyers is likely to be a fraction of what the White House has suggested and could taper off after an initial burst of buyers.\n\n\"Each week there is something else announced that's putting the steps in place to eventually get there,\" said Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners, which advises the wealthy on visas and passports. \"But there are still a lot of question marks in terms of how successful it will be at the end of the day.\"\n\nThe latest question centers on demand. While Lutnick touted the 70,000 sign-ups as proof of potential sales, anyone can sign up on the website requesting more information, regardless of their net worth. Immigration attorneys, family offices, bankers, wealth managers and all manner of advisors to the global wealthy said they signed up to stay informed on the Trump Card for their potential clients.\n\n\"I submitted two registrations so I can have access to more details when it becomes available,\" said Theda Fisher, partner at Withers Bergman LLP, who advises wealthy clients.\n\nThe population of people outside the U.S. worth $30 million or more \u2013 a reasonable cut-off for those willing to spend $5 million on a visa \u2014 is around 276,000, according to the latest numbers from data firm Altrata.\n\nImmigration attorneys said the largest demand is likely to come from China and the Middle East. China has around 46,000 ultra-high-net-worth individuals (those worth $30 million or more), Altrata said, while the Middle East has around 19,000. U.S. trade tensions with China and restrictions by the Chinese government on capital flight could limit the number of wealthy Chinese who buy a Trump Card, attorneys said.\n\nVolek, who applauded the program in concept, estimated that demand for the Trump Card will be around 2,000 a year.\n\n\"I think a couple thousand a year is achievable,\" he said.\n\nBy country, he said demand will likely mirror that of the current EB-5 program, the longtime U.S. visa regime that gives applicants residency and a pathway to citizenship for about $1 million. China dominates the EB-5 program, with mainland Chinese investors accounting for up to two-thirds of the 8,354 EB-5 visas issued in 2023, according to State Department data. Other countries in the common EB-5 applicant pool include Vietnam, India, Taiwan and South Africa.\n\nOther golden-visa advisors said they're seeing interest mainly from Mexico, the U.K., Russia and Brazil. The White House hasn't said whether the $5 million card covers a family or just an individual, which could also impact demand.\n\nCompanies could emerge as major buyers of the Trump Card as they seek tech talent from around the world. Trump said that Apple, for instance, would buy \"a lot\" of Trump Cards, according to reports. (Apple declined comment).\n\nUltimately, demand will all depend on the specific terms of the Trump Card, which are already causing controversy. Trump and Lutnick have said the Trump Card would replace the EB-5, which is supported with heavy lobbying and bipartisan backers in Congress. The EB-5 program, which ties investments to job creation in under-employment areas, was reauthorized until 2027, so any changes or termination would need congressional approval.\n\n\"The EB-5 program was created by Congress, and only Congress may abolish it,\" said the American Immigrant Investor Alliance, which seeks to increase the number of available EB-5 visas.\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nScreening and vetting remain another open question. After the U.S. discovered that Russians sanctioned after the Ukraine invasion had used its popular non-domicile program (similar to the Trump Card), it dramatically scaled back the program. It's unclear whether the Trump administration, which has been battling China over trade, would allow unfettered access to Chinese nationals who apply. The administration also hasn't commented on how it plans to screen for ties to terrorism, organized crime, money-laundering or foreign intelligence agencies.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for the Trump Card, however, involves taxes. The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world that taxes worldwide income, meaning American citizens and permanent residents have to pay federal income taxes on income earned outside the U.S. The only way wealthy foreigners would buy a Trump Card is if they're exempted from worldwide income taxes \u2013 giving Trump Card holders a massive tax benefit not available to U.S. citizens.\n\nWhile Trump confirmed that Trump Card holders would be exempt from overseas income, he said in a Truth Social post that \"wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card\" and be \"paying a lot of taxes,\" since they would still pay state and federal taxes on U.S.-sourced income.\n\nChanging the tax code for Trump Card holders will require congressional approval as well as approval from the IRS, according to tax experts. So far, there is no legislation in the Big Beautiful Bill or other bills addressing the change.\n\nThe unprecedented tax exemption could also lead to loopholes. Wealthy Americans, for instance, who have dual-citizenship in another country could renounce their U.S. citizenship, buy a Trump Card and regain access to the U.S. free of global-income taxes.\n\nThe administration has also yet to provide information about whether Trump Card holders would be exempt from estate and gift taxes \u2014 which are typically more important and more costly than income taxes for the ultra-wealthy.\n\n\"There are many questions we have, including how various tax positions will be treated, the duration of the ability to exempt taxation of global income, estate tax implications, and who will be included in a one donation,\" Fisher said. \"For this reason, we have asked most of our clients not to register and take a wait and see approach. Unless this program really makes sense from a long-term tax and estate perspective, many high-net-worth individuals will not apply.\"",

      "text": "A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\n\nThe $100 trillion wealth transfer from older to younger generations is set to reshape the wealth management industry, as younger investors plan to move their money to new advisors, according to a new report.\n\nA new survey from Capgemini shows that 81% of \"next generation millionaires,\" or those set to inherit large wealth from their families, plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms. Most cited poor digital offerings or a lack of services and products.\n\n\"We were staggered when our research came back with that number,\" said Kartik Ramakrishnan, CEO of financial services at Capgemini. \"What that generation looks for is different from what that previous generations have looked for.\"\n\nUnderstanding the next generation of inheritors will become increasingly critical to wealth managers as a historic transfer of wealth gets underway. According to Cerulli Associates, more than $100 trillion is expected to flow from baby boomers and older generations to heirs and spouses. A majority of the transfers (over $60 trillion) will come from millionaires and billionaires, representing the top 2% of households by wealth. And most of the flows will be in the U.S.\n\nThe firms that can best attract, retain and cater to the future of wealth will be best positioned for the future. More than two-thirds of wealth-management executives surveyed by Capgemini said they were focused on engaging the next generations.\n\nYet the gap remains wide. A majority (58%) of executives surveyed admitted it was \"challenging\" to build relationships with the next gen. Beyond age differences, the new breed of inherited wealth (those born between 1965 and 2012) are dramatically different from boomers when it comes to investing, priorities and lifestyles.\n\nHere are five of the top priorities of the next generation and how wealth managers can best adapt:\n\nYoung investors traditionally take more risk, given their timelines and age. Yet even adjusted for age, millennials and Gen Zers like to live further out on the risk curve, with meme stocks, stock options, cryptocurrencies and other more speculative asset classes.\n\nWhile the chief goal for wealthy boomers is wealth preservation, the next gen seeks aggressive growth, according to the Capgemini survey. The flood of online investing videos and explainers have also given younger investors more confidence taking risk.\n\n\"It's a combination of both age, risk propensity and awareness,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"It's the ability to find out more, to learn more, to get better knowledge of how they could invest.\"\n\nWhile older investors lean toward stocks and bonds, younger investors want more crypto, private equity and overseas investments. Fully 88% of investors say the next gen has more interest in private equity than baby boomers.\n\nCapgemini said younger investors believe strong returns can no longer be driven by just stocks and bonds, and that private equity and other alternatives can provide better long-term growth. Private equity is also becoming more widely available through lower minimums and third-party asset managers.\n\nWhile young investors want more crypto, two-thirds of wealth managers surveyed by Capgemini say they don't have investment options for emerging asset classes, including crypto.\n\nYoung investors are also more likely to venture overseas with their portfolios. A majority of millennials and Gen Zers say they want \"enhanced offshore investments,\" according to the survey. Of particular interest are the new wealth hubs around the world, including Singapore, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe next generations \"are more global,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"They have traveled more. They understand global dynamics. That enables them to be interested and get some of the returns that they're seeing in in these in these markets.\"\n\nYoung investors are digital natives, yet wealth management firms have been slow to adapt \u2014 still leaning on in-person meetings or phone calls for many client interactions. While 78% of baby boomers prefer face-to-face meetings over video calls, millennials want mobile apps that allow them to access and trade their portfolios.\n\n\"This is not a 'let's sit down with you once a year and walk you through how your portfolio is doing,' or once a quarter and walking through your portfolio is doing,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"This is an active engagement channel and with consumable nuggets of information that they should get.\"\n\nTwo-thirds of millennials say they expect advanced digital offerings from their wealth managers. Nearly half complain of a lack of services available on their preferred digital channels.\n\nAside from useful content in short \"nuggets,\" next generation investors want real-time access to all their financial information in one place, according to the report. They also want \"intuitive tools for decision making and secure transaction capabilities,\" according to Capgemini.\n\nMore than two-thirds of baby boomers want the next generation of inheritors to receive financial education to manage their inheritances responsibly. Yet many of the education programs from wealth management firms aren't proving effective. Some say the programs are too dry, or talk down to younger investors, or feel outdated.\n\n\"It's not just putting out these huge reports that talk about the impact of interest rates and what is happening with the market,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"That's hard for people to consume. It's got to be something that's simplified, that that people can pick up and something that's actionable.\"\n\nJosh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, which has built a large following among GenZers with its podcasts, blogs and social media, said young clients want more authentic, personal communications.\n\n\"\"The new generation grew up following people, not companies,\" Brown said. \"The winners in today's world are the firms that marry personalities and people the audience cares about with great products and services. We figured out years ago that it's make\u00a0someone into a fan first and those fans become your potential clients.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nAlong with tailored investment strategies, young investors are looking for a broader range of services related to their wealth. Estate and tax planning are key, along with philanthropy advice, according to Capgemini. They also want a growing list of concierge services, from luxury travel and bespoke experiences, to advice and insights into luxury purchases, including fashion, beauty, jewelry, wine and spirits.\n\nDespite their youth, next generations are also looking for quality advice on medical care and wellness, along with education advisory (i.e., admissions). Goldman Sachs , for instance, partners with a London-based concierge to offer medical concierge support, in-home consultations with doctors and education advisory.\n\nCybersecurity advice is also a fast-growing service for wealth management firms.\n\n\"It's that ability to get something that may be exclusive, that they may not be able to get otherwise,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"The next generations are more experience-driven than product-driven. So it's not about just buying luxury goods; it's luxury experiences, tailored experiences. Those are the kinds of partnerships that the wealth management firms can provide that will make and increase loyalty among that customer.\"",

      "text": "With a diamond encrusted ring here and a rare gemstone necklace there, the world's wealthiest are continuing to adorn themselves with the finest jewelry even as broader luxury shoppers pull back.\n\nBut make no mistake, one mother-of-pearl bracelet is not to be confused with another. As the super rich grow even more selective, increasingly only the best will do.\n\nThat spells positive news for Swiss luxury group Richemont , which boasts some of the luxury jewelry market's most sought-after brands, including Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati and Cartier.\n\n\"Richemont's jewelry brands are really at the top of consumer desirability,\" Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at Bernstein, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\n\n\"There's no debate. Despite the efforts by LVMH to challenge this leadership, I think that other brands are clearly behind.\"\n\nRichemont on Friday reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, led by 11% growth within its Jewellery Maisons division. For the full year, jewelry was also the group's strongest segment, growing 8%.\n\nThe results round off a results season in which major luxury names from LVHM to Kering and Burberry reported a slowdown in sales in the quarter to March, dashing earlier hopes of a turnaround in the embattled sector.\n\nSales within LVMH's watch and jewelry division, specifically, were flat year-on-year in the first quarter, having declined 2% on an organic basis in 2024 amid softer demand for key brands such as Tiffany & Co, Bvlgari, TAG Heuer and Hublot.\n\n\"We are gaining market share in jewelry, from branded and non-branded companies,\" Richemont's chairman\u00a0Johann Rupert said during an earnings call Friday.\n\nDespite the continued allure of its jewelry brands, however, Richemont is not entirely immune to wider sectoral headwinds.\n\nThe performance of its Specialist Watchmakers division, which features Piaget and Roger Dubuis, paints a more nuanced picture. Richemont's watch sales fell 13% in 2024, led primarily by weakness in China. That rate of decline eased only slightly in the second half of the year, thanks to recovering strength in the Americas.\n\n\"The global watch market experienced a slowdown affecting volumes. This was led by demand weakness in China, with greater resilience of high-end price segments,\" the company said in its report.\n\nClouding the picture further, many other premium Swiss watchmakers including Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, are privately owned, making their performance difficult to decipher.\n\nMacroeconomics aside, however, Bernstein's Solca said the fundamental nature of the luxury watch market \u2014 where products are typically positioned as long-term, if not lifetime, purchases \u2014 inevitably makes it slow to rebound.\n\n\"Everybody and their dog has bought a watch out of Covid-19 and that will take a while to digest. So I expect watches to be on the backfoot for a while longer,\" he said.\n\n\"People buy jewelry more frequently, and jewelry has become also cheaper relative to handbags last year, hence the better dynamic in that category.\"\n\nThe growth of the high-end jewelry market versus other haute couture staples such as fashion and leather goods could stand Richemont in good stead amid resurging global trade headwinds.\n\nRichemont's Rupert said Friday that the company would not take price increases that it cannot sustain, contrasting warnings of prices rises from other luxury and jewelry players.\n\n\"The business is increasingly reliant on its jewellery arm and will hope the strength of its brands in this area will sustain it,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said in a note Friday.\n\nNevertheless, analysts warn that the company may yet face challenges that threaten market dominance.\n\n\"Richemont continues to face several significant headwinds including the strength of the Swiss franc against the dollar, higher gold prices and the impact of tariffs,\" Mould added.",

      "text": "Shares of French fashion house Kering popped as much as 10% on Monday on reports that it has appointed industry outsider Luca de Meo as group CEO.\n\nIt comes as the owner of beleaguered brands Gucci and Saint Laurent embarks on the latest phase of its turnaround effort.\n\nAuto veteran de Meo's departure as CEO of Renault was confirmed Sunday, with the French carmaker saying in a statement that he was stepping down \"to take on new challenges outside the automotive sector.\" He will remain in post until July 15.\n\nDe Meo's move to Kering was first reported by French newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday. Kering declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC.\n\nKering shares were trading up 10.4% by 1:15 p.m. London time as investors and analysts cheered the reports. Renault shares, meanwhile, shed 7%.\n\n\"Brand management and marketing are [de Meo's] forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note Monday.\n\nDe Meo is seen as having a strong track record, having worked in the auto sector for over 30 years, including at Toyota , Fiat and Volkswagen . The Italian is largely credited with Renault's turnaround during his five years at the helm, with shares up over 90% over the period.\n\nThe challenges facing the luxury sector nevertheless loom large, with Kering among the biggest laggards as shoppers have fallen out of love with its star Gucci label. Kering shares have shed over 60% in the last two years, sparked by a series of profit warnings and designer changes at Gucci.\n\nKering's current CEO and chairman Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, a member of the family that controls the group, has held the top jobs for two decades but is actively working on his succession, according to Reuters, citing sources. Pinault reportedly intends to split the roles of chair and CEO, according to the sources. It was unclear whether he will remain chair.\n\nThomas Chauvet, senior equity analyst at Citi, commended de Meo's turnaround of Renault, including his embrace of technological innovation and the brand's elevation. However, he noted that the challenges of the prospective new role would be significant.\n\n\"Execution of luxury brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly, and far less public-market-friendly, reflecting consumer preference for top brands rather than those in transition and significant P&L disruption from greater investment commitment,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n\"There is still a considerable amount of work ahead at Gucci and Saint Laurent ... to rejuvenate both brands and generate a steady stream of revenue and cash flow for the group, which, if achieved, could result in significant multiple re-rating,\" he added.\n\nIn April, Kering posted a worse-than-expected 14% year-on-year decline in first quarter sales and pointed to macroeconomic headwinds ahead. Sales at Gucci, which make up nearly half of group revenues, led losses, falling 25% on a comparable basis.\n\nGucci in particular has suffered several consecutive quarters of weak sales, as its designs have fallen out of favor with shoppers, while its high exposure to the Chinese consumer has seen it hard hit by a recent downturn in the once lucrative Asian market.\n\nIn a bid to revive the ailing brand's fortunes, Kering in March appointed Demna Gvasalia as Gucci's new artistic director, joining internally from smaller label Balenciaga. However, a series of controversies associated with his earlier designs have so far prompted a cautious response from investors. His designs are expected to take effect from the Spring/Summer 2026 collections onward.",

See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is meeting once again this week to assess the health of the economy and potentially adjust the federal funds rate . Read on to learn more about the timeline for this meeting, what it involves, and expected outcomes.\n\nThe next FOMC meeting is set to take place on September 16-17, 2025. This will be its sixth scheduled meeting this year; the Fed has two more meetings on the schedule for the remainder of 2025.\n\nOnce the meeting concludes, the FOMC will release its policy decisions at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Then the Fed chairman will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe live news conferences held by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are livestreamed and recorded. Additionally, the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings are released three weeks after the date of the policy decision.\n\nKnowing when the Fed meets to discuss monetary policy and tuning into those meetings can help you gain a better understanding of how the economy is doing and help you make more informed decisions about your personal finances.\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut the federal funds rate for the first time this year. Following its last meeting, the Fed stated , \u201cAlthough swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\u201d\n\nHowever, in light of a weak jobs report released earlier this month, many experts believe the Fed will finally cut rates.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s impossible to predict with certainty when the Fed will make cuts and by how much. So, it doesn\u2019t hurt to be prepared.\n\nAhead of future Fed meetings \u2014 and possible rate cuts \u2014 consider taking the following steps to shore up your finances:\n\nLock in today\u2019s high rates: Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer attractive fixed rates, some as high as 4% or more . Securing a CD now can protect your returns before potential rate cuts diminish your interest-earning power. However, be sure to choose a term that fits your savings timeline. Locking in your money for too long could mean incurring early withdrawal penalties if you need to pull out cash before the CD matures. Plus, if the Fed eventually increases rates, you don\u2019t want to be stuck earning a lower yield.\n\nConsider refinancing soon: If you have a fixed-rate loan \u2014 such as a car loan, private student loan, or mortgage \u2014 refinancing could help you save money. But you may want to wait for the Fed to cut rates again before applying. In the meantime, work on ensuring you qualify for the best rates and terms available by improving your credit and paying down other debts.\n\nTime large expenses strategically : If you're considering a big-ticket purchase like a home or vehicle, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on interest rate trends. If you plan on securing financing, again, you may want to wait and see if interest rates get cut first. Until you\u2019re ready to make your purchase, consistently set aside savings in a sinking fund so you can put more money down and take out a smaller loan.\n\nRead more: A look at the federal funds rate over the past 50 years: How has it changed?\n\nClosing an HYSA you\u2019re no longer using can simplify your financial life, but it\u2019s not always the right move.

      "summary": "The late singer's widow, Jane, and the co-trustee of the estate, Richard Mozenter, have filed lawsuits against one another.",
      "text": "A court battle over the late singer Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate has highlighted the growing litigation over the trillions of dollars in wealth being passed down to spouses and families, experts said.\n\nJimmy Buffett's widow, Jane Buffett, filed a petition last week in a Los Angeles court to remove her co-trustee, Richard Mozenter, from the marital trust created to support her after the singer's death in 2023. Jane Buffett, who married Jimmy in 1977, alleged that Mozenter has been \"openly hostile and adversarial\" toward her and has refused to give her details on the trust and its financials. She alleged Mozenter is collecting \"excessive fees\" of $1.7 million a year and that he's mismanaging the trust assets, projecting income of only $2 million, implying annual returns of less than 1%.\n\nMozenter has filed his own lawsuit in Palm Beach County, Florida, alleging that Jane has been \"completely uncooperative\" in his efforts to manage the trust. He said Jane has interfered in business decisions, refused to meet with Mozenter and breached her fiduciary duties by \"acting in her own interest.\"\n\nThe case has put a spotlight on the estate plans and business empire left by Jimmy Buffett, the singer famous for hits like \"Margaritaville,\" \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" and other breezy, beach-vibe hits. Along with his song catalogue, Buffett left homes, cars, planes and a multimillion-dollar stake in his brand business.\n\nBuffett planned carefully for the afterlife. His will, first written more than 30 years ago and amended in 2017 and again in 2023, directed that most of his assets be placed in a marital trust for Jane. The trust was created \"for the wife's sole benefit of her lifetime,\" according to legal filings. The three children they shared \u2014 Savannah, Delaney\u00a0and Cameron \u2014 are the so-called remainder beneficiaries of the marital trust, which means they will receive any remaining assets left after Jane's death.\n\nJimmy Buffett also called for a co-trustee to manage the trust with Jane. He appointed Mozenter, an accountant who had also been his business manager and financial advisors for 30 years, as co-trustee.\n\nThe assets Buffett left were substantial. A successful businessman and entrepreneur, Buffett built a brand empire and merchandising business that far surpassed his song rights and touring. According to the filings, the assets in the estate included $34.5 million of real property; $15 million of equity in a company called Strange Bird Inc., which held Buffett's interest in various planes; $2 million in musical equipment; $5 million in vehicles; and $12 million in other investments.\n\nOne of the largest assets is Buffett's stake in Margaritaville, the chain of restaurants, bars, hotels and merchandising that commercialized the Buffett lifestyle. According to the filings, Buffett's equity in Margaritaville was estimated at $85 million, held though JB Beta. Margaritaville currently has 30 restaurants and bars, 20 hotels, and vacation clubs, casinos, cruise ships and merchandise.\n\nSoon after Jimmy's death, however, the relationship between two co-trustees soured. In her complaint, Jane Buffett said Mozenter refused to provide her with basic financial information about the trust. He \"belittled, disrespected, and condescended Mrs. Buffett\" in response to her request for information, she said. She said his fees of $1.7 million a year to manage the trust were \"enormous.\" When she asked for her projected income from the trust, Mozenter continued to delay. Finally, after she enlisted the help of her friend Jeff Bewkes, the former Time Warner chief, Mozenter provided her with an estimate of $2 million a year.\n\nAccording to Jane's complaint, Mozenter acknowledged that Margaritaville had paid distributions of $14 million over the previous 18 months. Yet he declined to make future projections. \"Based on that analysis, Mr. Mozenter told Mrs. Buffett that the Marital Trust's income would not cover her annual expenses and advised that she could 'consider adjustments,'\" according to her complaint.\n\nTrust lawyers said the case is part of a growing wave of lawsuits related to inheritances and trusts. Over $100 trillion of wealth is expected to be passed down from older generations to spouses and families over the next 25 years, according to Cerulli Associates. More wealth being passed down means more litigation, since families often fight over who gets what.\n\nThe Buffett case has reflected a different, but equally common, source of disputes: dueling trustees. Estate attorneys said Buffett could have made Jane the sole beneficiary as well as the sole trustee. Yet he chose to have Mozenter as co-trustee to help manage and direct the trust.\n\nMozenter said that during his lifetime, Jimmy \"repeatedly expressed his concerns regarding Jane's ability to manage and control his assets\" and was \"very careful to create the trust in a manner that precluded Jane from having actual control over the trust.\" He added, \"This fact has made Jane very angry.\"\n\nAttorneys said appointing a co-trustee is common. Sometimes the inheritor is ill-equipped to handle the wealth or asset. Sometimes they'd rather leave the details to someone else. Whatever the reason, tensions between the beneficiary and co-trustee often erupt into full-blown hostility.\n\n\"These cases almost all turn on the exact same issue,\" said Keith A. Davidson, with Albertson & Davidson LLP. \"You've got a beneficiary who doesn't feel like they're getting enough information and doesn't feel like they have any say. And you have a trustee who is being too paternalistic, and they feel like they can give out information what they want. That's a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.\n\nSubscribe here to get access today .\n\nEmotions run especially high when one of the trustees is a spouse.\n\n\"Imagine you're married to Jimmy Buffett for 47 years, you have a say in how you're spending your money and what you're doing and all that goes away overnight,\" said Stewart Albertson, also with Albertson & Davidson LLP.\n\nSince the lawsuits were filed in different states, courts will first have to decide where the case will be heard. After that, a judge will start arguments and ultimately decide a path forward. Attorneys said judges have typically sided with the outside trustee (in this case Mozenter). Yet increasingly, they have been siding with spouses \u2014 which could mean Mozenter is removed.\n\nMore likely, attorneys said, a judge will determine that the relationship between Mozenter and Jane is unworkable and name a new, professional or corporate trustee from a trust company or bank to replace them both.\n\n\"My guess is a judge is likely to put in someone as a professional fiduciary,\" said Alex Weingarten, managing partner of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP's Los Angeles office and chair of its entertainment litigation practice. \"That would allow the fiduciary to get in and figure out what's going on. It's not what she wants, but it would give credence to her argument.\"\n\nAttorneys said Mozenter's $1.7 million fee isn't necessarily excessive, since trustee fees can sometimes be as high as 1% or more of the assets each year. As for the return of $2 million a year on $275 million being proof of mismanagement, attorneys say many of the assets in the trust, like real estate, planes and cars, don't produce income and cost money to maintain. So the actual returns on income-producing assets could be higher.\n\nStill, attorneys said the Buffett case offers two important lessons for families planning wealth transfers. First, they said wealth holders should communicate the plans for their estates before they die so no one is surprised. If Buffett had explained the co-trustee roles to both Jane and Mozenter, perhaps tensions would have been minimized.\n\n\"Jimmy did good planning, in that he set these trusts up,\" Davidson said. \"But he didn't think about how this was actually going to play out.\" He also could have added a \"removal right\" in the trust to allow Jane to more easily remove Mozenter if she wished.\n\nThe second lesson is that friends or business associates don't always make good trustees. While today's wealthy often name a trusted friend to a family trust, the trustee may have a different relationship with the beneficiary and can see themselves as carrying out the wishes of the descendant \u2014 which is not the job of a trustee.\n\n\"In terms of problem cases, the ones we see, they rarely involve professional trustees,\" Albertson said. \"It's almost always somebody who's a friend. That tends to be the worst. Your role is to follow the trust terms.\"",

That reduces debt and interest costs as well. You can tap it, pay it back \u2014 and then circle back whenever you need more cash liquidity in your financial life.\n\nKeep learning: Can you use a HELOC for a down payment on a second home?\n\nA HELOC has two main components: You take out the money (the draw period ) and pay it back over time (the repayment period). That means you can borrow and pay back the money during the initial draw period, but you can't access the credit line during the repayment period.\n\nFor example, many HELOCs allow 10-year draws and then 20-year repayment periods, although there can be variations.\n\nBe sure to consider just how long you want to be saddled with the debt for something you spent money on years and years ago \u2014 and the interest you'll pay over what's likely to be 30 years.\n\nYou must have some value built into your house to qualify for a HELOC. That usually comes from years of payments and market-price appreciation. With 15% to 20% equity, you'll have enough to apply for a HELOC. As you did with your first mortgage, you'll want to shop around for the best offer.\n\nGetting a HELOC won't be as hard as it was to get a mortgage (we heard that sigh of relief), but there's still some paperwork to do. As always, your creditworthiness comes into play: things like your credit score, existing debt \u2014 you know the drill. Be patient. Expect the process to take a few weeks, and then revel in the surprise if it happens sooner.\n\nRead more: How to get a HELOC with poor credit\n\nWhen shopping for a HELOC, two options may be presented. Here's what you need to know.\n\nIt may seem pretty easy to understand an interest-only HELOC . You're not paying the debt down during the draw period; you're just paying interest to the lender. When the draw period ends, your payments are amortized with principal and interest.\n\nOne thing to remember: Most HELOCs have adjustable interest rates, so your monthly interest payment is likely to vary.\n\nSome lenders offer fixed-rate HELOCs . You may have to pay a fee to get it, but you'll lock in an interest rate on some or all of your balance for the long term. That's a good idea if interest rates are rising \u2014 maybe not so much if rates are expected to go lower.\n\nIn our current world of range-bound interest rates, it may be a toss-up. But the lure of an interest rate that won't jump higher can be appealing.\n\nThe repayment period on a HELOC can be grueling. You've depleted most of, if not all, your home's equity and now face many years of paying down debt. You might wonder if a HELOC can be refinanced . If you have already tapped out your home equity, the options may be limited. If you truly have difficulty making the payments, a loan modification may be your best choice.\n\nIf you wait, the answer is likely to be yes. The rules are changing. After the 2025 tax year, you may be able to deduct HELOC interest on your taxes regardless of what you used the proceeds for. Right now, the IRS says you have to spend the money to \"buy, build, or substantially improve\" your house for the interest to be deductible, up to a limit.\n\nDig deeper: How to pay off your mortgage with a HELOC\n\nCashing in on the equity in your house without selling it can be achieved in three additional ways besides using a HELOC.\n\nQualifying for a home equity loan (HEL) is similar to the process involved with a HELOC. The primary difference is that while you draw from a line of credit as you wish with a HELOC, a home equity loan is delivered in a lump sum of cash. There's no 10-year draw term, so repayment begins shortly after closing and can last from five to 30 years.\n\nOne other distinction: While HELOCs usually have variable interest rates with some lenders offering fixed-rate options for a fee, HELs are usually fixed-rate loans from the start.\n\nDig deeper: HELOC vs. home equity loan\n\nRather than adding a second mortgage to your home with a HELOC or a HEL, you can trade in your old home loan for a new cash-out refinance . You get the lump sum and make one payment on the new mortgage.\n\nRead more: HELOC vs. cash-out refinance\n\nIf you're 62 or older, a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) , the most common type of reverse mortgage, may be an appealing option. A portion of your equity can be distributed to you in a few ways: as a lump sum, a monthly payment to you, a line of credit, or a combination of a line and a monthly payment.\n\nAs you receive that money, interest and debt accrue against the home's value, which is repaid when you move, sell the house, or die.\n\nLearn more: HELOC vs. home equity loan vs. reverse mortgage\n\nA personal loan doesn't draw from your home's equity, but it can put cash in your pocket. And you don't have to put your home up as collateral. However, an unsecured personal loan can mean a higher interest rate.\n\nPersonal loans won't usually put tens of thousands of dollars in your pocket, but terms are shorter than HELOCs so your debt won't linger for decades.\n\nWe considered the following mortgage lenders for our HELOC best-of list, but they weren\u2019t quite as strong as our top picks.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSome offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nMortgage rates haven't moved higher in eight weeks, and this week they took a dive. The average 30-year fixed rate is down 15 basis points this week, and buyers are noticing. Freddie Mac reports that purchase loan applications are seeing the highest year-over-year growth in more than four years.\n\nThis could leave potential home buyers wondering, \u201c Is this a good time to buy a house?\u201d\n\nIn this article:\n\nAre mortgage rates dropping?\n\nSo, will mortgage rates go down at all this year?\n\nShould you wait to buy until mortgage rates go down?\n\nStrategies for buyers in today\u2019s mortgage market\n\nFAQs\n\nAs of Sept. 11, Freddie Mac reported that rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 6.35%. This time last year, mortgage rates were averaging 6.20%.\n\nIn situations like these, it pays to look at the numbers. Here\u2019s the Freddie Mac data on mortgage rates for the past 52 weeks as of Sept. 4, 2025:\n\n30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.08% to 7.04%\n\n15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.15% to 6.27%\n\nIf you just go by the numbers, rates on both 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages remain below the highs noted above. But, yes, mortgage rates have fallen recently. Will they keep dipping?\n\nDive deeper: Will mortgage rates go back up to 7%?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a substantial interest rate drop in 2025, you\u2019ll likely be left waiting. The latest news from the Federal Reserve and other key economic data point toward steady mortgage rates on par with what we see today.\n\nWhen the Fed \u2014 the common nickname for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 held its July 2025 meeting, it voted to keep the federal funds rate the same for the time being. After cutting its rate three times at the end of 2024, it has yet to slash the rate in 2025.\n\nThat federal funds rate tends to directly influence rates on shorter-term lending. While mortgage rates aren\u2019t directly based on the fed funds rate, they typically mirror fed fund rate trends. So, if the fed funds rate goes up, mortgage rates will likely follow. The inverse is also true.\n\nThe next Fed meeting is set for September 16 and 17. According to the CME FedWatch tool , there\u2019s almost no chance that the fed funds rate won't be cut at this meeting. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgage rates will follow suit. When people anticipate a fed funds rate cut, mortgage rates usually fall in the weeks leading up to the meeting.\n\nAnd they have.\n\nLearn more: How the Fed rate decision impacts mortgage rates\n\nWhile short-term lending rates closely follow the fed funds rate, mortgage rates more closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield . As of Sept. 10, the 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.03% \u2014 up from 3.65% a year prior.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why today\u2019s mortgage rates aren\u2019t in the 4% range , right?\n\nTo determine current mortgage rates , lenders add a \u201cspread\u201d to the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread is simply the difference between the rates consumers pay and the rate on the 10-year Treasury. Without getting too much into the weeds, charging a spread helps mortgage lenders cover costs associated with making loans to the public and the risk of providing such loans.\n\nFor example, the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.35%, and the 10-year Treasury yield is 4.03% \u2014 a spread of 2.32%.\n\nRead more: When will mortgage rates finally go back down to 5%?\n\nIn short, no. You probably shouldn\u2019t wait to buy a home until mortgage rates drop. Mortgage rates are just one part of the affordability equation. You also have to consider home prices, a factor of housing supply and demand.\n\nThe current housing market is in a crunch. To put it simply, buyers outnumber homes for sale, especially homes in price ranges accessible to the first-time home buyer . When supply and demand are out of balance like this, home prices tend to remain high since sellers know they\u2019ll have multiple buyers interested.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sale price of single-family homes has generally trended upward since Q1 of 2009. At that time, the median sale price was $208,400. The median price had risen to $410,800 by Q2 2025.\n\nWhile recession speculation has recently increased, prospective buyers likely won\u2019t see much relief in a true recession. If interest rates drop like they tend to do in recessions, that will increase the number of people looking to buy and lock in a lower interest rate. That drives up demand for the already limited supply of homes.\n\nTo truly save, buyers need both interest rates and home prices to drop . Mortgage rates are inching down this month, and housing prices are stagnant or even lowering in certain parts of the country. Still, rates are higher than they were this time last year, and prices are still increasing in many cities. Situations may be improving for buyers, but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\n\nKeep reading: Do mortgage rates go down in a recession?\n\nIf you crave the comforts of homeownership, the best strategy in today\u2019s market may be to buy what you can afford. Whether that means a smaller house or a condo instead of a single-family home, owning something puts you in a position to start building equity.\n\nYes, shopping for the best mortgage lenders with low rates and fees is crucial when getting a mortgage. But to help you find your ideal home that balances affordability and desirability, it pays to adopt a curious mindset and consider lesser-discussed financial tools.\n\nThere\u2019s no better time to learn more about your local real estate market than today. By adopting a sense of curiosity, you could discover that your city has more to offer housing-wise than you previously thought.\n\nYou may want to take weekend excursions to lesser-known neighborhoods and suburban developments beyond the city limits. You never know what you\u2019ll find that could expand your idea of what \u201chome\u201d looks like \u2014 including new developments, school districts, and types of homes .\n\nLearn more: This map shows average mortgage rates by state\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to spend less on a home in today\u2019s mortgage market, a house needing a bit of TLC could help you do just that. Loans like the FHA 203(k) mortgage can roll your purchase and renovation costs into one convenient loan. When you qualify and have an accepted offer, your lender immediately funds the home\u2019s purchase price and puts the cost of renovations into an escrow account. As you make repairs, funds get dispersed.\n\nHow would it feel to have a longer commute yet come home to a house you love? Master-planned communities tend to crop up outside major cities, offering amenities like parks, shopping, and top-notch schools \u2014 all in exchange for a longer commute. These areas could look a lot more palatable if they offer commuting options like park-and-ride or commuter rail. Dare to consider parking the car and taking public transit if it could get you into the home of your dreams.\n\nWhile shared walls, floors, and ceilings might not immediately scream \u201cdream home,\u201d they could help you find an affordable home in a terrific area. Condominiums come in various shapes and sizes, from apartment-style flats to townhomes. Depending on the area, you might even score a small backyard. However, be sure to consider HOA fees when calculating your monthly payment.\n\nWhile the monthly payment on a 15-year mortgage will be higher than the typical 30-year, these loans have plenty of upsides. Not only will you pay off your home on a speedier timeline, but you\u2019ll also likely score a lower interest rate and save a ton on interest over the life of your loan.\n\nTo make today\u2019s mortgage rates more palatable, look into rate buydown options. An interest rate buydown lets you pay cash up front in exchange for a reduced interest rate on your mortgage. Buydowns can be permanent or temporary (for your loan's first one to three years, for example). Even a few years of lower rate relief can make today\u2019s home prices more affordable.\n\nLearn more: What will mortgage rates do over the next five years?\n\nMortgage rates probably will not drop significantly through 2026. The August Fannie Mae Housing Forecast predicts that rates will continue to decrease gradually but will stay just above 6% throughout 2025 and 2026 .\n\nCompared to historical mortgage rates , 7% isn\u2019t considered a high rate. While it might be high compared to pandemic-era rates that were sub-3%, it\u2019s on par with mortgage rates in the 1990s, and considerably lower than the double-digit rates seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to get a 3% interest rate, but doing so requires the perfect set of circumstances. You\u2019d need to find a homeowner with an assumable mortgage \u2014 one that can be passed to a new owner at the same interest rate as the original loan. Assumable mortgages are generally government-backed loans from agencies like the VA, FHA, or USDA.\n\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.\n\nA mortgage note is a legal document explaining your home loan's details, and you\u2019ll sign it on closing day.

Interest on this account is compounded monthly.\n\nMoney market accounts can be a good place to hold your savings, but they function differently from a traditional savings account. Here\u2019s what you need to know about money market accounts before opening one.\n\nMoney market accounts help you achieve your short-term savings goals faster due to a higher annual percentage yield (APY) than regular savings or checking accounts. Plus, this type of account provides easy access to your funds, along with some of the best features of a checking account, such as debit cards and check-writing capabilities.\n\nLearn more: What is a money market account, and how does it work?\n\nA money market account is a type of deposit account that typically pays a higher yield than most traditional savings accounts and may come with a debit card and check-writing privileges. Although, like a savings account, there may be limitations on how much you can withdraw and how often. You can certainly use a money market account to grow your savings, but it isn\u2019t the same thing as a savings account.\n\nLearn more: Is a money market account a savings account?\n\nLike other interest-bearing deposit accounts, MMAs compound the interest you earn. Interest typically compounds daily and gets credited to your balance monthly (though this is not always the case). Compounding interest increases your APY because interest accrues not only on your principal balance, but on the interest you've accrued so far.\n\nLearn more: How often do money market accounts pay interest?\n\nThe current average savings account rate is just 0.39%, and the average money market rate is 0.59%, according to the FDIC. However, there are money market accounts that pay much more \u2014 as high as 4% APY or more.\n\nLearn more: What is the national average money market account rate?\n\nBecause money market bank account rates vary widely, it's important to choose an account with a competitive rate. This allows your money to grow faster.\n\nHere's how much you could earn if you deposited $10,000 into an account with one of the highest money market rates instead of a traditional savings account (assumes interest is compounded daily and credited monthly):\n\nMinimum balance requirements can vary. In some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum balance or initial deposit requirement to avoid a monthly fee or earn interest.\n\nLearn more: How much is a money market account minimum balance?\n\nLike other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Both the FDIC and NCUA offer $250,000 in coverage per institution, per depositor, per ownership category. That should cover most people, but individuals with high net worths may need to spread out their funds across multiple institutions to maximize their protection.\n\nLearn more: Are money market accounts FDIC-insured?\n\nMoney market accounts are generally safe, and you usually can\u2019t lose your principal deposit. However, there are some instances when you could lose money. For instance, fees and rising inflation can potentially eat into your account balance.\n\nLearn more: Can you lose money in a money market account?\n\nMoney market accounts and HYSAs are two types of accounts you can use to grow your savings. They\u2019re secure accounts backed by the FDIC or NCUA, and they both provide higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts do differ in several significant ways.\n\nLearn more: MMAs vs. high-yield savings accounts\n\nMoney market accounts and CDs are both deposit accounts that tend to offer higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, money market accounts offer greater access to your funds than a CD. CDs offer a high APY in exchange for locking up your funds for a set period of time.\n\nLearn more: MMAs vs. CDs\n\nMoney market funds and money market accounts may sound like the same thing, but they differ in a few key ways. Money market funds are not deposit accounts; they're a type of investment fund that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a basket of securities, such as stocks or bonds. A money market account, on the other hand, is a type of deposit account offered by many major banks and credit unions that typically pays a higher interest rate than traditional savings or checking accounts. MMAs may also come with a debit card, ATM card, and check-writing privileges.\n\nLearn more: MMAs vs. money market funds\n\nOpening a money market account is a fairly straightforward process. Once you\u2019ve explored the account options offered by various financial institutions, you\u2019ll need to gather some documentation. This may include your Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (TIN), government-issued ID, and proof of address. Once you have these documents in hand, you can begin your account application. This can be done in person, or in many cases, over the phone or online.\n\nLearn more: How to open a money market account\n\nOur grading system, collected and carefully reviewed by our personal finance experts, comprised more than 100 data points for close to 20 federally insured money market accounts to develop our list of the top 10 best money market accounts.\n\nWe evaluated these accounts according to several key metrics, including APY, minimum opening deposit, minimum balance requirements, monthly fees, interest compounding frequency, and more.\n\nThe accounts on our list could earn a maximum of 30 points across all metrics. Here\u2019s a closer look at the categories we considered:\n\nMonthly fees: Many money market accounts charge a monthly maintenance or service fee. We rewarded accounts with no monthly fees.\n\nMinimum opening deposit: Many money market accounts require a minimum deposit to open an account. Accounts with no or low minimum deposit requirements ranked more favorably than those with higher opening deposit requirements.\n\nAnnual percentage yield (APY): Accounts with higher APYs were rewarded with more points than those with lower APYs. Note that rates on our list are current at the time of publishing, but are subject to change at any time.\n\nMinimum balance to earn interest: Some banks and credit unions require a minimum balance to earn the advertised rate. We favored accounts that had no or low minimum balance requirements.\n\nAccess to funds: Many money market accounts offer easier access to your funds through check-writing, debit card, or ATM card privileges. We awarded extra points to the accounts that offered these features.\n\nWithdrawals per month or statement cycle: Many banks limit the number of free withdrawals or transfers you can make from your money market account each month or statement cycle. We rewarded those accounts that didn\u2019t set any limitations with extra points.\n\nCompounding frequency: Compounding can occur daily, monthly, quarterly, or even annually. We awarded more points to accounts that compound interest frequently.\n\nOverdraft fees: Many banks waive overdraft fees or do not charge fees at all if you overdraft your account. We awarded money market accounts that did not charge fees for overdrafts.\n\nIs it possible to find savings accounts with interest rates of 4% or more? See which banks currently offer 4% interest savings accounts and open an account today.\n\nSome banks allow unlimited withdrawals, while others impose penalties for withdrawing from your money market account too many times in a month.

      "text": "Oops, something went wrong\n\nSome offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nKnowing how the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decisions impact your interest earnings over time is key to making an informed decision about where to put your money. And with a rate cut on the horizon, the best option may be a certificate of deposit (CD).\n\nCDs can be a smart way to guarantee steady returns, especially if interest rates are expected to fall in the near future. Here's why you may want to consider opening a CD before the Fed's next meeting .\n\nThe federal funds rate is the target interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. It determines the rate that banks charge one another to borrow funds overnight in order to meet reserve requirements.\n\nThe federal funds rate is expressed as a range, which is currently 4.25%\u20134.50%. Banks negotiate a specific rate between each other within that range.\n\nThe Fed uses the federal funds rate as a tool to quell inflation . When inflation is high, the Fed raises its target rate to make borrowing money more expensive, which discourages consumer spending and helps bring everyday costs down. When the economy needs a boost, the Fed might initiate a series of rate cuts to encourage more spending and borrowing.\n\nRead more: A look at the federal funds rate over the past 50 years: How has it changed?\n\nChanges to the federal funds rate have major implications for financial institutions and the economy at large. But these decisions also affect your bottom line.\n\nAlthough the Fed\u2019s rate doesn\u2019t directly impact the interest rates set by individual banks for consumer deposit accounts and loans, they are closely correlated. When the Fed raises its rate, for example, interest rates on deposit products \u2014 including CDs \u2014 also tend to go up. And when it lowers its rate, deposit interest rates generally fall.\n\nThe Fed will meet again on September 16-17 and decide whether or not to adjust the federal funds rate. In its last meeting, the committee held the target range for the federal funds rate steady at 4.25%\u20134.50%, which it has maintained since the last rate cut in December 2024.\n\nAs economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace, many wonder whether the Fed will cut its target rate this year. In its last meeting, the committee released the following statement :\n\n\u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nMany experts believe the Fed will cut its rate in its September meeting , especially in light of a weak jobs report released earlier this month.\n\nEven so, we can\u2019t know for sure what will happen. So, while you wait for the Fed\u2019s official announcement about how rates will change (or not), it could be a good time to evaluate where you're currently keeping your savings and consider opening a new CD .\n\nShould the Fed decide to keep rates the same, it won\u2019t have a direct impact on CD rates, which means now is as good a time as any to open an account and take advantage of historically high interest rates. As it stands, the best CD rates today hover around 4% and up.\n\nHowever, if the Fed does decide to lower rates, now might be your last chance to lock in today\u2019s competitive CD rates .\n\nWhat does it mean to renew a CD? And should you? Here\u2019s what you need to know about CD renewals or rollovers.\n\nWant to earn more on your savings? Consider a promotional CD. Here's a look at the best limited-time CD rates available now.\n\nIs a certificate of deposit a good investment right now? That depends on your timeline and goals. Learn more about whether now is a good time to invest in CDs.\n\nAre CD rates expected to go up or down this year? Here\u2019s what could happen, according to experts.\n\nCDs and mutual funds are two ways to save for long-term goals. In this breakdown of a CD vs. mutual fund, learn how they differ in terms of risk, fees. and returns.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s important to avoid CD early withdrawal penalties. However, there are some situations when it could be worth incurring the penalty. Learn more.",

Balances above $6,000 do not earn interest.\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nThe amount of interest you can earn with a rate of 4% depends on how much money you deposit. The more money you keep in your account, and the longer you hold it there, the more you stand to earn thanks to compound interest.\n\nFor example, if you deposited $1,000 into a 4% interest savings account that compounds interest daily and left the money there for one year, you'd earn a total of $40 in interest (assuming you don't make any additional contributions).\n\nLet's say you deposited $10,000. At the end of the year, you'd earn $400 in interest. And if you made an additional $100 contribution each month, you'd end up with $421.84 in interest earnings.\n\nFinding a savings account that pays 4% on your balance is a great way to give your savings a boost and help it grow over time. However, there are additional steps you can take to get the most value out of your account.\n\nStart with a higher principal balance: The more money you deposit initially, the more interest you earn from the start.\n\nContribute regularly: Consider setting up automatic transfers to the savings account. Even small, consistent deposits can make a big difference over time. If you contribute $100 monthly \u2014 that\u2019s an extra $1,200 per year that earns 4% interest, which compounds to grow even more.\n\nTake advantage of compound interest: Make sure the interest on your account compounds at least monthly, if not daily. The more frequently interest is compounded, the more your money will grow.\n\nKeep your money in the account: Each time you withdraw funds from your savings account, the principal balance that earns interest decreases, which reduces the overall growth potential. A checking account or money market account may be a better fit for money you need for daily spending or paying bills.\n\nWatch out for fees: Look for a savings account with no monthly maintenance fees or other charges that could eat into your interest. Some high-yield accounts have minimum balance requirements to avoid fees or earn the highest advertised rate, so be sure you can meet those minimums \u2014 or choose an account with no minimum balance requirement.\n\nSavings accounts that offer 4% are becoming increasingly hard to find. Recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve signal that the economy is moving in the right direction, but they also mean deposit account rates are on the decline.\n\nAdditional rate cuts could be on the horizon, so it pays to take advantage of an account with a higher rate while it lasts.\n\nFor those looking to maximize their savings, it might be wise to take advantage of current rates while they remain elevated. If you want to lock in today's higher rates, you may want to consider a certificate of deposit (CD) instead of a high-yield savings account.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to increase your interest earnings, consider this new cash account from fintech app Marygold & Co.
