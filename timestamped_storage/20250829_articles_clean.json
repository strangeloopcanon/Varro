Shipping and tankers from our vantage point is still in the eye of the storm in relation to global conflict and trade policies. We have started to grow numb in respect of our industry's ability to regulate the ever-increasing parallel tanker market, stealing margins from the law-abiding citizens of the tanker trade. But now we are hopefully seeing the contours of change. one being trade policy reflected in nation's behavior on crude sourcing and the simple fact that global oil demand growth has surpassed what sanctioned molecules can satisfy, meaning incremental oil demand and supply for that sake, its growth seems to benefit the compliant fleet being the market Frontline operates in. So before I give the word to Inger, I'll run through our TCE numbers on Slide 3 in the deck. In the second quarter of 2025, Frontline achieved $43,100 per day on our VLCC fleet, $38,900 per day on our Suezmax fleet and $29,300 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet.

      "clean_text": "No Israeli government delegation will be invited to a global defence exhibition in London next month because of the Gaza war, the UK has said. \"The Israeli government's decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong,\" a UK government spokesperson said. \"As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025.\" Israel's defence ministry called the move a \"deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination\" and said it would be withdrawing and not setting up a national pavilion. UK leaders have become more outspoken against Israel's conduct in Gaza, including a recent plan to expand the war and take over Gaza City. \"There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\" the UK government spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. Individual Israeli defence firms will still be allowed to exhibit at the trade show, which will take place from 9 to 12 September. DSEI is Britain's flagship defence trade show \u2013 taking place every two years in London's Docklands \u2013 with hundreds of defence firms from all over the world exhibiting their military hardware and technology. It is backed by the government, which also invites foreign officials to attend. Israel's defence ministry said the UK's decision on this year's event \"introduces political considerations wholly inappropriate for a professional defence industry exhibition\". But the ministry said Israeli industries that chose to participate would receive its \"full support\". Liberal Democrats defence spokesperson Helen Maguire said the government was \"sticking its head in the sand if it believes this is a substitute for banning arms exports to Israel\". \"Anything less would be an utter dereliction of this government's duty to end the human catastrophe in Gaza,\" she said. The BBC has contacted other opposition parties for comment. DSEI is an opportunity to showcase a nation's defence industry, so governments will have stands to boost their own industry, even when most of that industry is run as a private enterprise. Activist groups had already been planning to protest at DSEI this year. Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) said while it welcomed the government's action, it criticised the move as \"cowardly and symbolic\". \"It was not the UK government that decided to pull the plug on the Israel country pavilion, but the Israeli government,\" the group's media coordinator Emily Apple said, adding the UK was still welcoming Israeli defence firms such as Elbit. \"This is the government pretending to take action while safeguarding the profits of arms dealers.\" Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in October 2023 in response to the Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostage back to Gaza. Currently, 48 hostages are still held there, 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israeli military actions in Gaza have since killed 62,966 people, including at least 18,592 children, the Hamas-run health ministry has said. The UN has said Israel has restricted aid, and UN-backed experts have confirmed famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas, with more than half a million people across Gaza facing conditions including starvation. Israel, which controls entry of goods into the territory, has denied this report and defended its military operation as a fight against Hamas. UK leaders have become increasingly critical of Israel's conduct in Gaza. In May, the UK suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza \"morally unjustifiable\". In recent months, Lammy said he was appalled and sickened by the plight of civilians in Gaza and called on Israel to allow \"unhindered\" aid into Gaza. This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Israeli strikes on a",

      "clean_text": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell to around $109,000 on Friday following key U.S. inflation data, though the markets continue to expect a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month, while worries around the central bank\u2019s independence persist. As of 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency last traded 3.8% lower at $109,070.0 It fell to a seven-week low below $109,000 earlier this week, but has rebounded slightly after that. Still, Bitcoin has fallen more than 10% from an August record peak above $124,000, and was set for its first monthly drop since April. The token is poised to fall about 6% in August, after four consecutive monthly gains. U.S. inflation picked up in July, with the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge showing tariffs are filtering through the economy. The Commerce Department said Friday that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy, rose at a 2.9% annual rate, the highest since February and up slightly from June. On a monthly basis, core prices climbed 0.3%, while the broader index increased 0.2% for a 2.6% yearly gain\u2014both in line with forecasts. The Fed views core PCE as the best guide to underlying inflation. Markets still expect policymakers to cut rates again at their meeting next month. Fed Governor Christopher Waller signaled Thursday he would consider a larger reduction if labor data weaken further. Rate cut optimism generally boosts speculative assets like crypto, but President Donald Trump\u2019s attempted firing of Fed Governor Lisa Cook earlier this week dampened risk appetite. Cook refused to resign and filed a lawsuit challenging the move, saying her removal would undermine the Fed\u2019s independence. The rare clash has unsettled investors wary of political influence over monetary policy. Bitcoin often comes under pressure during periods of heightened macroeconomic and political uncertainty, despite being promoted by some investors as a hedge. American Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining company backed by Donald Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Donald Jr., aims to start trading on Nasdaq in early September 2025 via a reverse merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, according to a Reuters report. Trump sons and the firm\u2019s largest investor, Hut 8 , collectively control about 98% of the firm, the report said. Altcoins were largely down on Friday, tracking the declines in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. World no.2 crypto Ethereum fell over 6% to $4,292.43. World no. 3 crypto XRP declined 5.5% to $2.84. Solana lost 1.4% to $208.61 Cardano fell over 5%, while Polygon traded marginally higher. Among meme tokens, Dogecoin slid 4.4%, while $TRUMP slipped 3%. (Ayushman Ojha contributed to this report.)",
      "excerpt": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell to around $109,000 on Friday following key U.S. inflation data, though the markets continue to expect a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month, while worries around the central bank\u2019s independence persist. As of 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency last traded 3.8% lower at $109,070.0 It fell to a seven-week low below $109,000 earlier this week, but has rebounded slightly after that. Still, Bitcoin has fallen more than 10% from an August record peak above $124,000, and was set for its first monthly drop since April. The token is poised to fall about 6% in August, after four consecutive monthly gains. U.S. inflation picked up in July, with the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge showing tariffs are filtering through the economy.",

      "clean_text": "An MSP has denied hiding a secret camera in a toilet at the Scottish Parliament, after being barred from entering the building. Colin Smyth, 52, was suspended by Labour earlier this month over a separate charge of possessing indecent images of children. Smyth criticised Police Scotland for releasing details of its investigation and said it had forced him to leave his home to protect his family. The South Scotland MSP said he was \"fully co-operating\" with officers and is due to appear at Dumfries Sheriff Court at a later date. He will now face a further charge over hiding a camera in the Holyrood building in Edinburgh. In an email to staff on Thursday, the parliament's corporate body said that Smyth's building access had been revoked due to the \"ongoing criminal investigation\". The Scottish Parliament has confirmed that police had searched all toilets and changing rooms but found no \"covert recording devices\". In a statement, Smyth said: \"This allegation has come as an utter shock and one I strongly refute.\" The MSP, who was arrested in Dumfries on 5 August, has held several frontbench roles with Scottish Labour and was previously the party's general secretary. The statement continued: \"The speculation, and recent decision by the police to release publicly details of their ongoing inquiries along with my home address has been devastating and has taken a serious toll on my health. \"After my address was published, I felt I had no choice but to move away to protect my family.\" Smyth previously worked as a modern studies teacher and has a wife and two daughters. He added the police investigation was \"especially overwhelming\" for them. In an email to MSPs on Friday, the Scottish Parliament said that staff \"safety and welfare\" was its priority. Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone wrote: \"We can confirm that Police Scotland, with our support, have conducted a full sweep of all toilets and changing rooms in our building and that no covert recording devices have been found. \"We have also instructed that enhanced additional checks to our existing security sweeps of the building take place going forward.\" The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body revoked Smyth's access to the building ahead of MSPs returning from the summer recess next week. It is understood that Smyth could still contribute to debates and vote remotely using a system set up at Holyrood during the pandemic. Scottish Labour said that Smyth was now an independent MSP after it took \"swift action\" when the party became aware of the police investigation. A spokesperson said: \"We cannot comment further on these deeply concerning developments while legal proceedings are ongoing.\"",

      "title": "Bank share prices tumble after calls for tax on profits",
      "clean_text": "The share prices of leading UK banks have tumbled following calls for the government to introduce a new tax on banking profits. Traders and investors reacted to suggestions that the government could raise up to \u00a38bn a year with a windfall tax on the sector. The proposal comes from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank which argues it is a way to claw back taxpayers' money which is being spent supporting the banking sector. The Treasury has not commented on the policy, but concerns led to NatWest, Lloyds and Barclays being the biggest fallers on the main index of the London Stock Exchange early on Friday. NatWest and Lloyds share prices were down by more than 4% in morning trading, and Barclays had dropped by more than 3%. Charlie Nunn, the chief executive of Lloyds bank, has previously spoken out against any potential tax rises for banks in the government's Budget announcement this autumn. He said efforts to boost the UK economy and foster a strong financial services sector \"wouldn't be consistent with tax rises\". The Treasury has been contacted for comment. The IPPR, a left-leaning think tank, said a levy on the profits of banks was needed as the Bank of England's quantitative easing ( QE) drive was costing taxpayers \u00a322bn a year. After the financial crisis and in 2020, the Bank of England began buying bonds - essentially IOUs it receives a fixed interest rate for - to support the financial sector and reduce longer term interest rates. To buy these bonds, the Bank borrowed money from commercial banks, and those banks are paid interest on those reserves. While the Bank started reversing its QE strategy in 2022, it is still losing money on the programme because the interest rate it pays on reserves has shot up, while the rate it gets from the government bonds it holds has remained the same. In addition, the Bank of England is making a loss on unwinding its QE programme as it is selling bonds at a lower price than it paid for them. The IPPR said the Bank of England is now making huge losses, which it described as \"a government subsidy to commercial banks\", and highlighted commercial bank profits compared to before the pandemic were up by $22bn. The tax suggestion comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the difficult task of meeting her own self-imposed rules on taxation and spending when she sets out her Budget strategy for the next five years. Carsten Jung, associate director for economic policy at IPPR and former Bank of England economist, said the Bank and Treasury had \"bungled the implementation of quantitative easing\". \"Public money is flowing straight into commercial banks' coffers because of a flawed policy design,\" he said. \"While families struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.\" Speaking on BBC's Today programme, Mr Jung said the \u00a322bn taxpayer loss was roughly equivalent to \"the entire budget of the Home Office every year\". \"So we're suggesting to fix this leak of taxpayer money, and the first step would be a targeted levy on commercial banks that claws back some of these losses,\" he said. A tax targeting the windfall profits linked to QE would still leave the banks with \"substantially higher profits\", the IPPR report said , while saving the government up to \u00a38bn a year over the term of parliament. But financial services body UK Finance said that a further tax on banks would make Britain less internationally competitive. \"Banks based here already pay both a corporation tax surcharge and a bank levy,\" the trade association said. The corporation tax surcharge was introduced by the previous government in 2021, and is an 8% levy on the profits of banks, on top of the standard corporate tax rate. The Bank levy, introduced in 2011, is another tax on banks' business activities, but is based on banks' balance sheets, or the scale of their business, rather than profits. UK Finance said a new tax on banking would \"run counter to the",

      "clean_text": "Cayman Islands, British Overseas Territories, August 29th, 2025, Chainwire Gate, a leading global digital asset trading platform, officially launched its new investment certificate, GUSD. Supported by real-world assets (RWA) such as U.S. Treasury bonds, GUSD provides users with low-risk, stable investment returns. By leveraging blockchain technology, it brings steady yields of traditional finance into the crypto world, serving as an important bridge between TradFi and DeFi, and offering users a safer, more predictable option for asset allocation. With the launch of GUSD, Gate has fully enabled trading, deposits, withdrawals, and related investment functionalities. Users can directly exchange USDT for GUSD on the spot market, or mint GUSD at a 1:1 ratio using USDT or USDC through Gate\u2019s \"Staking\" page. This allows users to conveniently obtain GUSD whether they wish to trade flexibly in the spot market or generate stable returns through RWA minting. GUSD will also serve as a Unified Account contract margin, supported from day one. As of August 29, 2025, Gate has officially opened trading for major cryptocurrency pairs and Simple Earn flexible savings for GUSD, further expanding its circulation and utility. Meanwhile, Gate Launchpool has officially opened its first GUSD staking pool, allowing users to stake GUSD and share CELB token rewards, with an estimated annualized yield of up to 365%. Additionally, lending, CandyDrop, and other functions for GUSD are gradually being rolled out. Once conditions are met, Gate will also collaborate with quality projects to launch GUSD staking pools, providing additional liquidity incentives to attract market attention. Unlike stablecoins that serve solely as a medium of exchange, GUSD itself is an investment certificate with an appreciation attribute. Its returns are derived from the interest generated by the underlying RWA assets. Users do not need to collect interest daily; instead, they receive both principal and accrued interest upon redemption. For example, if a user mints GUSD with 100 USDT and the accumulated return reaches 20% at redemption, they will receive 120 USDC. This mechanism gives GUSD not only stability but also growth over time. While holding USDT simply preserves value for market transactions, holding GUSD is effectively equivalent to indirectly holding a continuously appreciating portfolio of U.S. Treasury-backed assets. Gate stated that as the product continues to expand, the total fund size of GUSD is expected to exceed $100 million in the near term, establishing a more solid market foundation. The platform will also gradually disclose reserve proofs and cooperation details with custodian institutions, ensuring that users can publicly verify that every GUSD issued is fully backed by real-world assets, guaranteeing 100% reserves. Users redeeming GUSD receive USDC, which can then be converted into USDT or other cryptocurrencies, enhancing the credibility and transparency of the product\u2019s dollar-asset linkage. With over $4 billion in managed investment assets and years of robust compliance and operations, Gate provides strong assurance of GUSD\u2019s security and transparency. Compared with RWA products from leading platforms like Binance, GUSD not only follows the same underlying logic but also offers greater flexibility for users, supporting dual-currency minting with USDT and USDC for easier access worldwide. Gate\u2019s launch of GUSD offers a new solution to the long-standing question of how to achieve stable returns in the crypto world. It transforms stablecoins into a secure, transparent, and sustainable digital investment option. As trading pairs, lending, Simple Earn, and staking scenarios continue to expand, GUSD is poised to become the preferred tool for users seeking to allocate assets and achieve long-term growth. About Gate Gate, founded in 2013 by Dr. Han, is one of the world\u2019s earliest cryptocurrency exchanges. The platform serves over 36 million users with 3,600+",
