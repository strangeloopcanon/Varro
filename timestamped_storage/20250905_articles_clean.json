Transcript Rena Sherbill: Brian Stewart, Seeking Alpha's Director of news, welcome back to Wall Street Roundup. Brian Stewart: Great to be here. RS: Set the stage for us. What's top of mind for you as we start September, a shortened trading week? Talk to us. BS: If we're talking themes, I think, the jobs data is coming out. We're recording this Thursday, so listeners will probably have a little bit more information than we do right now about what the jobs data is gonna say. That puts into the frame of the Federal Reserve. Currently, there's a 97% chance, according to the FedWatch tool, that the Fed's going to cut rates in September. That's been inching higher recently. So it was kind of in the mid eighties as of last week, but has now kind of reached the the level of in that inevitability. Obviously, the idea of a rate cut has become highly politicized. The Fed is basically at war with the president. So maybe having this cut happen might relieve some of that tension, that might give markets a little relief, not to mention the relief that's gonna come with the idea that their rates are gonna be lower. One issue though is the inflation statistics remain kind of unmovable. You haven't seen those metrics show much relief. You're seeing inflation in the PCE last week showing just under 3%, 2.9 annual growth. Next week, we got CPI coming out, probably gonna show something very similar. So you see the Fed facing the sticky inflation with the tariff impact still TBD. Meanwhile, the jobs data has started to underwhelm to the point where rate cuts are becoming inevitable. So that tension's going to be critical for the next couple weeks. RS: And anything you would mention as we talk about governments and monetary policy, it makes me think of the record prices that gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has been hitting, silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) has been surging. How much are you looking at the precious metal sector, the bond sector perhaps? BS: It's interesting to to think about the two high profile parts of the market right now remain AI and gold, which seem very far removed in terms of the usual constituencies for those investments. So it's kind of interesting that that's where we're at, where you have an inflation hedge that's become very popular as a place to store money for many investors. Meanwhile, people are still making bets in the AI space, hoping that'll be the engine for the market to go higher. And meanwhile, you have kind of this middle ground where most of equities are falling, where it's more a stock picker kind of situation. So I do think that's something to keep an eye on, is the further activity in the gold market because I think that'll give a great sign of what people feel about inflation. RS: And earnings wise this week, what were you focused on? BS: So there were a lot of retailers that came out and it was kind of a interesting mix there. You had Macy's ( M ) which which popped after its earnings. Investors seeing signs of a turnaround there. Its stock rose 21% after its earnings, is up 71% from its April lows. April was when the worst of the tariff fears hit the retail sector, which was one of the hardest hit areas, with that scare. It's still off a fifty two week high though. It reached its fifty two week high late last year, so it needs another 8% to get up there. The company said that it faced tariff headwinds, but saw sales improvement for its luxury brands like Bloomingdale's. So you see there may be a worry that the higher prices, both from underlying inflation and the tariffs are going to cut into consumer spending, especially on the low end where people have less resources. Meanwhile, you might find some winners in the luxury space because those brands",

      "clean_text": "iSpecimen Inc. (ISPC) announced it has been approached by several cryptocurrency companies presenting investment opportunities as the biospecimen sourcing company pursues plans to build a $200 million digital asset treasury. The Woburn, Massachusetts-based company said the approaches include opportunities in tokenized real-world assets and highly ranked cryptocurrencies. iSpecimen continues parallel discussions to develop a Solana blockchain-based treasury program, according to a company statement. \"We are refining our approach to build a digital asset treasury. While the acquisition of Locked Solana appeals, we recognize there are many opportunities that we continue to explore,\" said Robert Lim, chief executive officer. The company plans to establish a SOL-based treasury program using the native token of the Solana network to diversify its balance sheet and support growth initiatives. iSpecimen intends to source treasury management expertise for policy design, counterparty diligence, execution, custody coordination, risk management and reporting. The treasury program contemplates purchasing SOL through over-the-counter transactions with cryptocurrency institutions, including Locked SOL that carries contractual transfer or vesting restrictions. Locked SOL typically trades at a discount to spot prices due to illiquidity and lock-up risk. iSpecimen plans to fund the treasury program primarily from capital raised periodically. The company said it will employ a buy-and-hold strategy and purchase locked SOL at discounts. Plans include staking the Solana holdings to generate yields while maintaining a small percentage for spot trading. iSpecimen operates an online marketplace connecting scientists with healthcare providers for human biospecimens used in medical research.",
