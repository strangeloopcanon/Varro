Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\nCisco is expected to continue its current trajectory, with growth primarily driven by its core sectors\u2014telecommunications and cloud services. However, the sector is facing intensified competition from established players like AWS and Azure, which may slow pace growth and reduce margins. The company\u2019s strong presence in key markets could weaken its competitive edge, particularly in saturated segments. A timeframe of 2\u20133 years is likely, with a focus on maintaining its core competencies while navigating market shifts. The key driver is the evolving competitive landscape, which could reduce demand and erode Cisco\u2019s valuation.",
