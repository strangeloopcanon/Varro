Gold is likely to maintain its position as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, particularly in regions facing rising interest rates or trade tensions. Silver, however, is expected to benefit from increased demand in sectors such as renewable energy, healthcare, and technology, with a focus on long-term investment in strategic assets.

Key sectors expected to remain strong include retail services, digital banking, and the energy and infrastructure sectors, which are heavily influenced by interest rate dynamics and consumer demand. The sector is likely to see continued growth in these areas, with a focus on digital transformation and demand for fintech solutions. The timeframe for this growth is projected to align with the broader economic recovery, with a moderate acceleration over the next 12\u201318 months. The key driver is the ongoing impact of central bank interest rate decisions, which could drive demand for high-yield products and services in the retail and financial sectors.",
