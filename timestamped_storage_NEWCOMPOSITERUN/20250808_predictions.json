The company\u2019s focus on emerging markets and technology sectors is likely to yield positive results, with a particular emphasis on the energy and manufacturing sectors.

Meanwhile, the financial sector is expected to see a moderate decline due to economic uncertainty and increased competition in the market. The timeframe for this outlook is expected to be within the next quarter, with the most significant impact occurring in Q2.  \n\n**Example of a Sector or Asset Expected to",

They mentioned avoiding meta-instructions and using specific indicators. The tone should be professional and focused, with a clear structure. I should avoid jargon and keep it detailed but not overly complex.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sectors that are likely to be affected by tariff revenue. Maybe sectors like manufacturing, technology, or services. The key driver here would be the increase in consumer demand and the rise in exports. The timeframe could be from 2025 to 2030. Specific indicators could be GDP growth, exports, or sector-specific performance metrics. For each paragraph, I should highlight the direction, magnitude, timeframe, and sector. Let me start drafting the first paragraph about manufacturing. Then the second about technology, and the third about services. Make sure each paragraph is concise and each point is clear.

          "raw_prediction": "Keep it professional and concise.\nAlright, let's tackle this. The user wants a forecast for Under Armour's stock, focusing on the CEO's stance on tariffs and their impact on profits. They need specific assets, sectors affected, direction/magnitude, timeframe, and a key driver. They want it concise, professional, and avoid meta-instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify Under Armour's key assets. They have healthcare, fitness, and consumer products. The tariffs in the US are affecting supply chains, especially in healthcare and consumer goods. So, healthcare is a big sector. The CEO's position on tariffs could lead to a shift in supply chain strategies. \n\nExpected direction: Maybe a slowdown in the healthcare sector, but consumer goods could see growth. Timeframe: 12-18 months. Key driver: Tariffs affecting supply chains, leading to cost increases. Need to make sure the forecast is concise and covers all points without being too detailed. Check for professional tone and avoid any unnecessary jargon. Make sure each sentence flows naturally and the key points are clearly stated.\nOkay, I think I have a good structure. Start with the sector affected, mention healthcare and consumer goods. Then the direction, magnitude, timeframe, and key driver. Keep it brief and professional. Avoid any markdown and keep it concise. Let me put it all together now.\nAlright, I need to make sure the forecast is concise, covers all the required points, and is professional. Let me check again. Under Armour's healthcare and consumer goods sectors are likely to be affected. The CEO's stance on tariffs could lead to cost increases, affecting these sectors. The direction is a slowdown in healthcare but growth in consumer goods. Timeframe is 12-18 months. Key driver is tariffs affecting supply chains. That should cover everything. Now, write it in a concise and professional manner.\n**Forecast:** Under Armour's stock is likely to face challenges as the U.S. tariffs on its global supply chains impact key sectors, particularly healthcare and consumer goods. The healthcare sector, which relies heavily on pharmaceuticals and medical devices, could experience reduced demand due to tariffs, while consumer goods, such as personal protective equipment and apparel, may see increased costs. The magnitude of these effects is expected to be moderate, with a slowdown in the healthcare sector and a potential uplift in consumer goods. The timeframe for these impacts is projected to be within the next 12-18 months. The key driver is the ongoing effects of the tariffs on supply chains",

Amidst this, Amazon is expected to continue its dominance in e-commerce, but with new challenges emerging. A key driver for the sector is the ongoing uncertainty in the global supply chain, which is affecting the ability of companies to deliver goods on time. This could lead to a decline in demand for services such as logistics and delivery, which are critical to the success of Amazon. The sector is expected to see a reduction in growth, with a timeframe spanning the next few months. The magnitude of the impact is anticipated to be moderate, with potential for a 5-10% decrease in revenue. The key driver is the global supply chain disruptions, which may lead to a temporary halt in the flow of goods and services. This could result in a significant drop in stock prices, with the sector being a major area of concern. The analyst believes that the worst drop in Amazon's stock will be due to a combination of factors, including the impact on its core business operations and the external factors related to the global economy. The timeframe for the worst drop is expected to be within the next several months, with the decline likely to be temporary and moderate.
