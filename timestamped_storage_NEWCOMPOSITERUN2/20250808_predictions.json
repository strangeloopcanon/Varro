Check for any missing elements and ensure it's within the required length. Alright, that should cover it. Let me put it all together in a clear, concise way.\n</think>\n\nEnerflex Ltd. is expected to continue its strong growth in the renewable energy and storage sector, driven by increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions and the shift towards a low-carbon economy. The company will focus on key assets such as solar and wind energy infrastructure, battery storage systems, and energy storage solutions, with a particular emphasis on expanding its footprint in these areas. The sector is anticipated to grow at a rate of 20-30% annually, with a timeframe of 2025-2027, and the key driver is the accelerating global transition to renewable energy and the need for efficient, scalable energy storage solutions.",
