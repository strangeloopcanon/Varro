Costco is a major retailer, so likely to have a strong presence in consumer goods, home goods, and maybe some industrial sectors.

Consumer spending on goods and services is likely to remain strong, particularly in sectors such as consumer goods, home goods, and personal care, as demand for everyday essentials and premium products increases. These areas will see a continued surge in sales, with a focus on expanding into new markets and improving existing product lines to meet evolving consumer preferences.  \n\nThe broader economy\u2019s recovery will also play a significant role, as industries such as retail, logistics, and services may experience a rebound. Costco\u2019s existing retail footprint is likely to continue to expand, with a focus on maintaining and enhancing its core strength in key areas. The key driver is the resilience of consumer demand and the positive impact of the economic recovery, which will support long-term growth and stability. The timeframe is expected to be within the next 12\u201318 months, with a gradual acceleration in sales and growth across all relevant sectors.",
