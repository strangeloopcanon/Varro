I need to structure the forecast into three to five sentences, each focusing on a different sector. Also, the tone should be formal and avoid any meta-instructions. Let me start by stating the current price and the factors influencing it. Then, for each sector, mention what's expected. For example, in Financial Services, maybe the interest rate environment. In Technology, maybe the adoption of blockchain. For Education, maybe the shift to digital learning. Energy sector could see a drop in prices due to uncertainty. Agriculture might see a decline if demand is reduced. Insurance might see a shift in risk management. Retail could face challenges if traditional stores lose customers. The timeframe should be a few months. The key drivers are trade, economic uncertainty, and possibly regulatory changes. Need to check if all sectors are covered and the information is concise. Make sure each sentence is a separate point without overlapping. Alright, let's put it all together now.\n**Forecast:** The Bitcoin price is projected to remain stable at $114,400, driven by ongoing trade and economic uncertainty, which are expected to affect sectors such as financial services, technology, and retail. In financial services, interest rates may adjust, impacting investment portfolios. Technology sectors, including blockchain and decentralized applications, could see growth due to adoption. Retail will likely experience reduced consumer spending, affecting traditional stores. Energy and agriculture may see a decline in prices, while healthcare and insurance sectors could experience shifts in demand. The timeframe for this trend is in the next few months, with key drivers expected to persist. **Key",
