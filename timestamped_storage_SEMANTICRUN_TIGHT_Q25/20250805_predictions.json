The main prediction is that the US will increase tariffs on Brazil's agricultural products, leading to decreased demand and production. I need to name two-3 specific sectors, mention direction (up or down), magnitude (1-3%), timeframe (2-4 weeks), and key drivers. The example given is a single paragraph, so I need to condense that into 3-5 sentences. Let me check the example again to make sure I'm on the right track. The example uses the same structure as the user's input, but I need to rephrase it into a concise paragraph. Let me start by stating the main prediction, then list the sectors affected, their direction, magnitude, timeframe, and drivers.

They want a concise forecast paragraph for ACMR's Q2 2025 earnings call transcript. The main prediction is a 1\u20133% increase in revenue, with a 2\u20134% increase in core assets. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks. Key drivers include strong performance in main business segments and core assets. I need to make sure the paragraph is within 3\u20135 sentences, no markdown, plain text, no headings, bullets, code, or meta-instructions. The user provided the forecast, so I need to condense it into a single paragraph. Let me check the example they gave. The example starts with the main prediction, then names the assets or sectors affected, states the direction, magnitude, timeframe, and key drivers. I should follow that structure but in a more natural flow. Make sure to avoid any markdown and keep it simple. Alright, let's put it all together.\n</think>\n\nThe company is expected to see a 1\u20133% increase in revenue, driven by strong performance in its main business segments, with a 2\u20134% increase in core assets.
