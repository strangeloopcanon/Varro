The agricultural sector is expected to see a 1\u20133% decline due to reduced demand for exports and decreased investment in agriculture. The manufacturing sector is expected to experience a 1\u20133% decline due to reduced demand for exports and decreased investment in manufacturing. The timeframe is within the next quarter, and the key drivers are the ongoing trade war with the US, reduced demand for exports, and decreased investment in agriculture and manufacturing.
