        "article_excerpt": "Russia has carried out a massive overnight attack on 14 regions of Ukraine, authorities have said, as Kyiv struck Russian oil refineries. One woman was killed in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and 30 people were injured - including children - according to local officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, urging tough new sanctions on Moscow. Following the attack, Russia's defence ministry said all \"targets of the strike have been achieved\" and \"designated objects have been hit\" - a claim that has not been independently verified. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The latest barrage comes amid ongoing international efforts to secure a peace deal between the two warring nations - and days after the Ukrainian capital Kyiv faced the second largest aerial attack of the war so far, with at least 25 killed."

The so-called reciprocal tariffs - imposed on nearly every country the US trades with - are being illegally imposed, the US Court of Appeals said on Friday. The decision upholds a ruling in May from the Court of International Trade, which also rejected Trump's argument that his global tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act. Many of the tariffs that would be affected by the ruling stem from an announcement in April of a flat 10% rate on imports from all countries, which Trump said would even out \"unfair\" trade relations with the US. The court did not halt the tariffs but instead said they would remain in place until mid-October, setting up a further legal challenge in the US Supreme Court."

Also, make sure that the sentence structure is correct.\n\nOkay, I need to write a forecast paragraph based on the given headline and context. The user wants it to be concise, 3\u20135 sentences, with a timeframe and key drivers. Let me start by checking the headline: \"Bitcoin: May Outperform As Fed Pivots To Ease Policy (Rating Upgrade)\". The context mentions that Bitcoin was at a peak in January 2025, and now the Fed is pivoting to ease policy, which could boost Bitcoin. The key points from the context are increased investor confidence, lower demand, and macroeconomic recovery.\n\nSo, the main prediction is Bitcoin may outperform. The assets affected would be Bitcoin and maybe other sectors like tech or energy. The direction is up, and the magnitude is 1\u20133%. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks. The key drivers are increased confidence, lower demand, and macroeconomic recovery. I need to structure this into a single paragraph without instructions. Let me make sure each sentence is a complete thought and the timeframe is included. Also, check for correct sentence structure. Alright, putting it all together.\n</think>\n\nBitcoin",
