        "article_excerpt": "Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Craig Short are three of a group of retired footballers who say they are victims of \"financial abuse\" A group of former Premier League footballers say they lost tens of millions of pounds because of their financial advisers. Danny Murphy, Michael Thomas and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. Former England midfielder Murphy - now a Match of the Day pundit - believes he lost roughly \u00c2\u00a35m because of \"financial abuse\". David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, say they \"deny any wrongdoing\". They told the BBC: \"At all times, Kingsbridge advised in good faith and set out the risks and opportunities both before and after any investment was agreed."
