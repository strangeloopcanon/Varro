The key drivers are the reduction in tax credits for renewable energy, the shift towards cleaner energy, and the ongoing global focus on climate change. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks, and the magnitude is approximately 1\u20133% for these sectors. The forecast is based on the anticipated decline in fossil fuel prices and the growing demand for clean energy solutions. As tax credits for renewable energy decrease, investors may shift their focus to cleaner alternatives, leading to increased demand for solar and wind energy. This will drive up the value of clean energy ETFs like ICLN. The market is expected to see a positive trend in the coming weeks, with the potential for a 1\u20133% increase in value as investors look to capitalize on",

        "article_excerpt": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin stabilized on Wednesday after recouping some recent losses, although traders were seen remaining largely cautious towards crypto markets amid uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs and lower interest rates. Safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar outpaced Bitcoin this week, as rising concerns over high debt levels in the developed world also added to risk aversion. Caution ahead of key U.S. labor data this week, which is likely to factor into the outlook for U.S. rates, also weighed. Bitcoin rose 0.25% to $111,580 by 09:33 ET (13:33 GMT). Increased Bitcoin buying by world no.1 corporate holder Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ), did little to buoy prices. The Michael Saylor-led firm purchased about 4,048 Bitcoin for nearly $450 million in the last week of August. Elsewhere, digital tokens belonging to U.S."

Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. The players lost tens of millions of pounds and some now owe millions in tax. Lord Mann, Alex Sobel MP and Sarah Bool MP said the case was \"a failure of regulation, accountability and duty of care\". They were speaking in response to the BBC documentary Football's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11, which aired on Tuesday. David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, have denied any wrongdoing."
