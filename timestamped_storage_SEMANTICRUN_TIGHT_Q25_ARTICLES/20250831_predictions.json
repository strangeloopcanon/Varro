The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on \"maximising extraction\" to get \"all our oil and gas out of the North Sea\" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday, She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up \"paying the price through higher energy bills\". The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: \"We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy.\" Exploring new fields would \"not take a penny off bills\" or improve energy security and would \"only accelerate the worsening climate crisis\", a government spokesperson warned."

The market is currently assigning a roughly 85% chance of a September rate cut, driven by concerns over economic data and the potential impact on financial markets. The weakening of the U.S. economy could lead to increased borrowing costs, which could impact corporate profits and investor sentiment, leading to a broader market correction. Additionally, the energy sector's demand for oil and gas could see a rebound as investors seek to hedge against potential rate cuts, potentially leading to a 3\u20135% increase in energy prices. The overall market is expected to experience a mixed response, with a combination of sector-specific declines and potential recoveries in certain areas. The timing of the rate cut is crucial, as it could have a significant impact on the financial markets, potentially leading to a broader market correction within the next quarter. The market is currently in a state of tension, with the Fed's decision having the potential to shape the upcoming economic landscape and impact the broader market. The market is expected to respond with a mix of reactions, with a potential for a sharp decline in stock prices and a mixed response in the energy sector, as investors seek to hedge against the potential rate cuts. The timeframe for the rate cut is expected to be within the next quarter, with the market's response to the decision being a key factor in determining the outcome. The key drivers for the market response include the potential impact on financial markets, the energy sector's demand, and the overall economic outlook, with the Fed's decision playing a significant role in shaping the market",

The user wants a single paragraph forecasting what happens next based on the headline and context. The main prediction should be stated first, then two- to three specific assets or sectors affected, their direction, magnitude, timeframe, and key drivers. The language needs to be the same as the original article, which is English. The paragraph should be 3\u20135 sentences. \n\nFirst, the headline says that flawed jobs data threatens the Fed's September rate cut. The context mentions the market's uncertainty and economic data's potential impact. I need to mention the main prediction here. The assets affected might be something like equities, bonds, or commodities. Let's say equities and bonds. The direction could be up or down, and the magnitude might be 1\u20133%. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks. Key drivers could be inflation, interest rates, or economic indicators. Wait, the original context says \"economy data is likely to decide whether the Fed cuts rates\". So the market is uncertain, and the data will determine the rate cut. The assets affected would be equities, bonds, or commodities. Let me check the example given in the context. The example uses \"equities\" and \"bonds\". So maybe equities and bonds. The magnitude could be 1\u20133% in both. Timeframe within 2\u20134 weeks. Key drivers: economic data, inflation, interest rates. I need to structure this into a single paragraph without markdown. Let me put it all together now.\n**Your answer:**\nThe market is poised for a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve, with equities and bonds likely to see a 1\u20133% increase or decrease depending on economic data, and the timeframe expected within 2\u20134 weeks. Key drivers include inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and shifting consumer confidence, which could influence investor sentiment and market performance. The outcome hinges on the accuracy of the economic data that will determine the Fed's decision to lower rates. [The answer must be in English, same as the original",

Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan \"Mr Fix It\" type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care. In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. \"His eyes lit up,\" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. \"He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do.\" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away."
