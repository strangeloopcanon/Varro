      "title": "Starmer resets after Rayner row, but Labour turmoil is a gift for Reform",
      "clean_text": "Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025. The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style. And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times. These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping \"How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy\" was a joke. And what was planned as No 10's \"get back in charge week\" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up \u2013 the housing secretary in trouble for not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax on her expensive new house. Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team. The start of this political season has been wild. In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut. The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken. Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed. There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake. It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster. It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis. She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called \"Mr Rules\" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, ahem , flexible attitude to the normal rules. She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust. For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the \"service of the people\", as Sir Keir said so many times \u2013 to be competent, with clean heels. For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, \"it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight\". And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world. \"There's just the smell test,\" a Labour insider said. This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not. Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now. The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument. Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust. Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday. The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days? Making changes to his ministers. The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making. Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: \"None of",

      "clean_text": "iSpecimen Inc. (ISPC) announced it has been approached by several cryptocurrency companies presenting investment opportunities as the biospecimen sourcing company pursues plans to build a $200 million digital asset treasury. The Woburn, Massachusetts-based company said the approaches include opportunities in tokenized real-world assets and highly ranked cryptocurrencies. iSpecimen continues parallel discussions to develop a Solana blockchain-based treasury program, according to a company statement. \"We are refining our approach to build a digital asset treasury. While the acquisition of Locked Solana appeals, we recognize there are many opportunities that we continue to explore,\" said Robert Lim, chief executive officer. The company plans to establish a SOL-based treasury program using the native token of the Solana network to diversify its balance sheet and support growth initiatives. iSpecimen intends to source treasury management expertise for policy design, counterparty diligence, execution, custody coordination, risk management and reporting. The treasury program contemplates purchasing SOL through over-the-counter transactions with cryptocurrency institutions, including Locked SOL that carries contractual transfer or vesting restrictions. Locked SOL typically trades at a discount to spot prices due to illiquidity and lock-up risk. iSpecimen plans to fund the treasury program primarily from capital raised periodically. The company said it will employ a buy-and-hold strategy and purchase locked SOL at discounts. Plans include staking the Solana holdings to generate yields while maintaining a small percentage for spot trading. iSpecimen operates an online marketplace connecting scientists with healthcare providers for human biospecimens used in medical research.",
