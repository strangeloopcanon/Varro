(1:30) Global bond market selloff . (2:59) This is an abridged transcript of the podcast: Our top story so far, shares of PepsiCo ( NASDAQ: PEP ) are gaining ground on the heels of reports that Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a substantial stake in the company. The Wall Street Journal says Elliott now holds a $4 billion stake amid efforts to make \u00e2\u0080\u009cchanges to boost its sagging share price.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Elliott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in Pepsi, which is reportedly the hedge fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest equity position ever, makes it one of the snack and beverage maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top five active investors, excluding index funds. Recent shifts in consumer tastes, especially in regard to carbonated beverages, as well as lost market share in its snack business has resulted in a 14% decline in shares year-over-year versus only a 4% drop for rival Coca-Cola ( KO ). Additionally, Pepsi has dropped to fourth place in U.S. sales volumes behind Coke, Dr. Pepper ( KDP ) and Sprite ( KDP ). The Journal suggests Pepsi could initiate strategies similar to those taken by Coca-Cola such as returning company-owned bottling operations to local, independent bottlers, or possibly splitting the company into two entities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 food and beverage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to unlock value in the beverage business. Seeking Alpha analyst Julia Ostian says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe issues we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the past, like weak demand for beverages in North America, are becoming more and more apparent, which should worry long-term investors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slip, it was a solid quarter for PepsiCo, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the core concerns around growth sustainability and payout quality,\" she added. Also in the snack space, Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) said that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off. The split aims to simplify operations and let each new company focus on its own goals, improving performance while keeping the scale needed to stay competitive. The names of the two companies are yet to be determined. But one company will focus on sauces, spreads, seasoning and shelf-stable meals with brands including Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The other will focus on grocery staples including brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. And Nestle ( OTCPK:NSRGY ) CEO Laurent Freixe has been ousted for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a subordinate. He has been replaced by Philipp Navratil. Chairman Paul Bulcke said: \"This was a necessary decision. Nestl\u00c3\u00a9's values and governance are strong foundations of our company.\" Among other active stocks, Constellation Brands ( STZ ) is under pressure after the beer, wine and spirits company cut its fiscal 2026 financial outlook , citing weak consumer demand. The company now sees a consensus EPS outlook of $11.30 - $11.60, down from $12.60 - $12.90. The consensus EPS estimate for the year is $12.65. Molson Coors Beverage ( TAP ), Anheuser-Busch InBev ( BUD ), Brown-Forman ( BF.A ) and Boston Beer ( SAM ) are down in sympathy. And Signet Jewelers ( SIG ) is up after sliding past estimates with its second quarter earnings. For Q3, Signet sees revenue of $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion (midpoint $1.36 billion) vs. $1.34 billion consensus. Looking to the markets, rates are moving higher amid a global bond selloff. The 30-year Treasury yield ( US30Y ) climbed as high as 4.98%, its highest level since July, as the possibility of the U.S. having to refund tariff money arose after Friday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court ruling. The selloff was even sharper in the UK, where the 30-year gilt yield jumped to its highest level since 1998. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt 5.69%, this ( GILT ) yield has increased 35 basis points over the past 30 days",

      "clean_text": "Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Craig Short are three of a group of retired footballers who say they are victims of \"financial abuse\" A group of former Premier League footballers say they lost tens of millions of pounds because of their financial advisers. Danny Murphy, Michael Thomas and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. Former England midfielder Murphy - now a Match of the Day pundit - believes he lost roughly \u00c2\u00a35m because of \"financial abuse\". David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, say they \"deny any wrongdoing\". They told the BBC: \"At all times, Kingsbridge advised in good faith and set out the risks and opportunities both before and after any investment was agreed.\" Up to 200 footballers may have been affected, with some losing their homes and being made bankrupt. They are now being chased for millions more in tax, despite being told by City of London Police they were \"victims of crime\". Football's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11 shows how coming together as a team helped the group survive and gave them the conviction to go public. It will air on BBC Two and the BBC iPlayer on Tuesday, 2 September from 21:00 BST. This goal from Brian Deane for Sheffield United against Manchester United was the first scored in the Premier League Brian Deane is another member of the V11 group. He scored the first Premier League goal in 1992. It ushered in a new era, with money flooding into the game and players becoming richer than ever. \"We should have felt protected,\" said Deane, who - like others - hoped the investments would secure his financial future. \"Kingsbridge seemed to be in line with what everybody wanted at the time, which was to have somebody looking after your finances for when you finished playing.\" Kingsbridge Asset Management was founded in Nottingham by McKee and McMenamin in the same year as the Premier League. Its website boasted a client list of more than 360 footballers. \"If they got the most influential person in the changing room, you thought you were in a safe place,\" said Deane. \"It was like wildfire - word of mouth.\" Tommy Johnson (left) invited David McKee (middle) and Kevin McMenamin (right) to the 1996 League Cup final Former Aston Villa and Celtic striker Tommy Johnson was introduced to Kingsbridge by his agent. \"They were my financial advisers and a lot of the players' advisers at Villa,\" he said. Johnson went on holiday with McKee and McMenamin, and they were even guests at his wedding. \"People will turn around and say they were just financial advisers,\" he said. \"They weren't, they were friends. These guys have ruined our lives.\" McKee and McMenamin told the BBC: \"We were honoured during our careers to have been trusted by [our] clients... that trust was never betrayed.\" The company gained credibility through its relationship with the League Managers Association. Kingsbridge administered the LMA's website and obtained an endorsement from then chairman Howard Wilkinson, who managed Leeds United and England. Howard Wilkinson was chairman of the League Managers Association for 32 years before standing down in 2024 Howard Wilkinson (left) and Rod Wallace (right) won the First Division title with Leeds in 1992 Wallace became Leeds' record signing in the summer of 1991. \"It was one of the major advantages for us - to know that managers were involved,\" he said. \"Me and my wife were looking to have a family. It was just a natural thing really, just go with them.\" It was only in 2008 that Wallace noticed something going wrong with his investments. His net worth at one point was \u00c2\u00a31.9m. By February 2024, he was declared bankrupt. \"We live in Surrey,\" he said. \"It's been a good place to live but we have to move on now because of an eviction notice, nothing in the bank. We won't have anywhere to live.\" Wallace was also a shareholder in Kingsbridge. \"It was my first purchase of",
      "excerpt": "Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Craig Short are three of a group of retired footballers who say they are victims of \"financial abuse\" A group of former Premier League footballers say they lost tens of millions of pounds because of their financial advisers. Danny Murphy, Michael Thomas and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. Former England midfielder Murphy - now a Match of the Day pundit - believes he lost roughly \u00c2\u00a35m because of \"financial abuse\". David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, say they \"deny any wrongdoing\". They told the BBC: \"At all times, Kingsbridge advised in good faith and set out the risks and opportunities both before and after any investment was agreed.",

      "clean_text": "Montreal, Canada, September 2nd, 2025, Chainwire Vincent Boucher, widely recognized as one of the earliest pioneers in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), today announced the evolution of ( AGI Alpha ), a blockchain-native AGI-First platform designed to redefine how intelligence is orchestrated, shared, and monetized globally. The platform\u2019s first release, a Meta\u2011Agentic AGI Alpha Jobs Marketplace , introduces a decentralized, blockchain-embedded job-routing system powered by the $AGIALPHA utility token, now live on Solana. The Visionary Behind the Innovation Boucher\u2019s remarkable journey underpins AGI Alpha\u2019s mission. Born in 1973 in Qu\u00e9bec City, he endured a difficult childhood in foster care before discovering a passion for knowledge at age 14 that would define his life. By his early 20s, he had completed a B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics in a single year, followed by a Master\u2019s degree in Government Policy Analysis and (1998) and a Master\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering (2000). From 2000 to 2002, he provided management consulting for the Canadian Space Agency before committing himself fully to AI in 2003. Further solidifying his status as a thought leader, Boucher has helmed MONTREAL.AI and QUEBEC.AI as President since 2003, consistently at the forefront of AI innovation. In 2016, he achieved global recognition on OpenAI\u2019s Gym benchmarks, demonstrating the power of the scaling principle in AI years before it became an industry standard. That same foresight led him, in 2017, to unveil the seminal \u201cMulti-Agent AI DAO\u201d blueprint, introducing the concept of \u201cMeta-Agentic\u201d systems: AIs designed to create, coordinate, and direct other AIs. From 2016 to 2018, Vincent Boucher (username: \u201cceobillionaire\u201d) generally ranked #1 worldwide on the OpenAI Gym. In 2017, Boucher unveiled the seminal \u201cMulti\u2011Agent AI DAO\u201d blueprint, now hailed as a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of foundational IP at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain. This 2017 design was developed years before today\u2019s multi-agent AI trend, and laid the groundwork for what would become AGI Alpha. Now, after two decades of quiet innovation, Vincent Boucher is channeling his expertise and vision into AGI Alpha \u2013 the culmination of his life\u2019s work \u2013 to fundamentally transform the AI landscape. A Revolutionary Meta-Agentic Platform AGI Alpha represents the culmination of Boucher\u2019s two-decade AI journey, introducing a Meta\u2011Agentic architecture that enables AI systems to design, coordinate, and manage other AI entities . This paradigm shift moves far beyond traditional single-agent or query-response models (like mainstream AI systems such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini) toward autonomous, multi-agent task execution and scalable value creation . In AGI Alpha\u2019s ecosystem, AI agents don\u2019t just chat or answer questions \u2013 they collaborate, negotiate, and execute complex jobs on-chain , orchestrated by smart contracts. The platform is blockchain-embedded at its core: users around the world post sophisticated tasks (or \u201cjobs\u201d) on the network, which are then picked up and completed by a constellation of intelligent agents coordinated via code. This innovative approach is underpinned by advanced algorithms and a unique blockchain architecture that orchestrates agent interactions through smart contracts, ensuring trustless coordination and transparent reward handling . Crucially, AGI Alpha focuses on capabilities that other industry players have yet to address, positioning itself not as a competitor to existing AI chatbots, but as a leap into a new domain of autonomous AI coordination and on-chain execution . At its core is a recursive intelligence flywheel: every completed job feeds shared memory, reputation, and tooling, compounding capability with each cycle. Decentralized by design, optimizations emerge from the collective; an agent\u2011of\u2011agents conductor harnessing swarms of specialists to solve problems no single system could tackle alone.

The Washington-based provider of AI-driven policy and regulatory intelligence solutions said the initiative aims to increase shareholder value through balance sheet diversification. The company cited recent legislative developments, including the GENIUS Act and related regulatory initiatives, as creating a clearer framework for digital assets. \"Just as we\u2019ve previously announced that we plan to leverage stablecoins to drive future global customer expansion, we also are seeking to take advantage of broader opportunities in the evolving financial and technological landscape,\" said Josh Resnik, CEO and President of FiscalNote. FiscalNote stated that its expertise in global policy and regulatory matters provides strategic advantages in evaluating digital assets as legislation and rulemaking shape the cryptocurrency sector. The company noted that governments and institutions are increasingly integrating digital currencies into policy and reserves. The company said digital currencies could provide diversification, liquidity, 24/7 market access, and serve as a hedge against macroeconomic risks. FiscalNote acknowledged that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile while citing expanding global acceptance and diverse use cases as factors warranting evaluation. FiscalNote said it will continue focusing on its core mission of delivering policy and regulatory intelligence while managing its financial strategy to support long-term growth.
