Healthcare demand is expected to grow, driven by an aging population and rising insurance needs, potentially leading to a 1\u20133% increase in demand. Technology demand is projected to rise due to the growth of remote work and digital transformation, with a 2\u20134% increase. Energy demand is anticipated to increase as global demand for renewable energy sources rises, with a 1\u20132% increase. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks, and key drivers include the continued growth of these sectors, increased consumer spending, and the impact of global economic conditions. By 2025, the Federal Reserve may pause interest rate cuts, leading to a potential increase in the interest rate environment. The healthcare, technology, and energy sectors are expected to see a significant growth in demand, which could affect the overall economic environment. The Federal Reserve is likely to consider these sectors as key areas to focus on, potentially leading to a more stable interest rate environment.

You may use markdown, but only the markdown.]\n[Note: Please make sure that the forecast is in the correct structure and that the paragraph is only one paragraph. You may use markdown, but only the markdown.]\n\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants a single paragraph forecasting the next few weeks based on the provided headline and context. The main prediction should be stated first, followed by specific assets or sectors affected, their direction, magnitude, timeframe, and key drivers.\n\nFirst, the headline mentions that bond yields are still attractive, down from their highs, and compared to the last 10 years. The context states that investors can lock in these yields for years. The main prediction should be that bond yields will remain stable or slightly decrease, affecting assets like bonds, stocks, or sectors that depend on fixed income. \n\nI need to pick 2\u20133 assets or sectors. Maybe bonds, stocks, and sectors that rely on fixed income. The magnitude could be a 0.5\u20131% decrease. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks. Key drivers might include inflation, economic recovery, and the current bond yield environment. \n\nWait, the user said to include a concrete timeframe. The example uses \"within 2\u20134 weeks\" or \"next quarter.\" The note says to include a timeframe. Also, the note says to use only the headline/context without instructions. Let me check the example again. The example uses \"within 2\u20134 weeks\" and \"next quarter.\" \n\nSo, the first sentence is the main prediction. Then, the assets or sectors affected. Direction and magnitude. Timeframe. Key drivers. \n\nI need to make sure it's all in one paragraph, no markdown, just plain text. Let me put it all together.\n**Forecast**: Invesco Core Bond Fund Q2 2025 will see continued stable bond yields, with potential slight declines due to inflationary pressures and economic recovery. Bonds, stocks, and sectors reliant on fixed income will experience a 0.5\u20131% decrease, with demand likely to remain strong within the next two",

The first sentence is about the main prediction. Then I need to name two-3 specific assets or sectors affected, state direction and magnitude. Then timeframe and key drivers. The example given is tech and consumer goods. Let me make sure the timeframe is within the next quarter, and the key drivers are the slowing consumer demand and rising interest rates. Also, the magnitude is 1\u20133% for tech, 1\u20132% for consumer goods, and 2\u20134% overall. The example in the text uses \"up 1\u20133% / lower demand\" but the user's example uses \"drop in the next few weeks, with a primary impact on the tech sector and consumer goods.

          "raw_prediction": "\"The Fed Will Cut Interest Rates In September? Don't Be So Sure\"\n\nAnswer: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in September, but the impact will be mixed. In the short term, the economy may see a slowdown in growth, with sectors like consumer goods and technology facing potential declines. However, during the next quarter, the rate cuts could lead to increased borrowing and investment in emerging markets, potentially boosting growth in sectors such as renewable energy and infrastructure. Key drivers include the potential for a stronger U.S. economy and the Fed's focus on inflation control. The exact timing and magnitude will depend on economic data and global market conditions. The Fed's decision is expected to be a response to inflation and economic concerns, with the effects likely to be seen in the coming months. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks, and the magnitude will vary based on the specific economic indicators and market responses.

Opting to go with 11 of the 12 who triumphed in Rome two years ago makes perfect sense for Europe's bid to defend the Ryder Cup in what, he says, will be a Bethpage \"bear pit\" at the end of this month. All six of his wildcard selections - Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka, Jon Rahm, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland and Matt Fitzpatrick - played in the 16\u00c2\u00bd-11\u00c2\u00bd victory at Marco Simone two years ago. With Rasmus Hojgaard snatching his debut through automatic qualifying, the Dane replaces his twin brother Nicolai in the only change. Never before has there been so little rotation of players between teams in Ryder Cup history."

The main prediction is that interest rates could go lower than markets think, with specific assets or sectors affected. The assets mentioned are the U.S. dollar appreciating against the euro and yen, leading to reduced demand for foreign assets. The U.S. economy could slow down, causing reduced consumer spending. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks, and the drivers are the dollar's appreciation and economic slowdown. I need to structure this into a single paragraph, avoiding any markdown. Let me check if I'm including all elements: main prediction, specific assets or sectors, direction and magnitude, timeframe, drivers. Yes, that's covered. Now, make sure the language is plain and concise. Avoid any instructions, just the forecast. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n",
