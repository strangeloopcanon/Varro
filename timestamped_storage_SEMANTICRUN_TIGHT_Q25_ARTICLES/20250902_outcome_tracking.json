The market will likely continue to show a 1\u20133% decline, with a potential for a 0.5\u20131% increase in the energy sector due to increased demand for renewable energy solutions.\" The forecast includes a timeframe of within 2\u20134 weeks and a 1\u20133% decline in the S&P 500, with the technology and energy sectors experiencing a 1\u20133% decline.

The main prediction is Bitcoin price bounces back to $111k amid Fed easing bets; US jobs data eyed. Bitcoin price is expected to rebound to $111k, with a potential up 1\u20133% in the next week, driven by Federal Reserve rate easing and a strong US job data showing a 2\u20134% increase in employment, which will push demand for Bitcoin. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks, and key drivers include the Federal Reserve's rate easing and strong US job data. The sector affected includes technology and finance, as both sectors are expected to see increased demand for Bitcoin due to the economic environment and the Federal Reserve's rate easing.

Additionally, sectors like tech, finance, and energy will see a 1\u20133% decline, with a 2\u20134% increase in demand from other sectors. The timeframe is within 2\u20134 weeks. The key drivers include the Fed's easing policies, increased demand from traders and institutional investors, and the impact of the US jobs data. The magnitude is 1\u20133% for Bitcoin and 1\u20132% for the other sectors.
