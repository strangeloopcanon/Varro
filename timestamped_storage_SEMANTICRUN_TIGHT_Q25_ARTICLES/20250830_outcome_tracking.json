The decision upholds a ruling in May from the Court of International Trade, which also rejected Trump's argument that his global tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act. Many of the tariffs that would be affected by the ruling stem from an announcement in April of a flat 10% rate on imports from all countries, which Trump said would even out \"unfair\" trade relations with the US. The court did not halt the tariffs but instead said they would remain in place until mid-October,",

Gate Launches GUSD: A Stable Investment Backed by Real-World Assets GUSD's launch marks a pivotal shift in the crypto landscape, with its integration of real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bonds and GUSD itself as a stable investment. This move is expected to attract both traditional investors and DeFi enthusiasts, driving demand in sectors such as forex and commodities. With a 1:1 ratio and a 2\u20134 week timeframe, GUSD is projected to see a 1\u20133% increase in market value, supported by factors like regulatory support and institutional adoption. The platform's expansion into spot and staking functions further solidifies its role as a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi, positioning it as a key player in the global crypto market. Gate is anticipated to capitalize on this",
