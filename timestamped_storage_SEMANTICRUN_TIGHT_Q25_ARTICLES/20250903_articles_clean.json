      "title": "Bitcoin price today: little changed at $111.5k amid caution over US rates, tariffs By Investing.com",
      "clean_text": "Investing.com-- Bitcoin stabilized on Wednesday after recouping some recent losses, although traders were seen remaining largely cautious towards crypto markets amid uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs and lower interest rates. Safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar outpaced Bitcoin this week, as rising concerns over high debt levels in the developed world also added to risk aversion. Caution ahead of key U.S. labor data this week, which is likely to factor into the outlook for U.S. rates, also weighed. Bitcoin rose 0.25% to $111,580 by 09:33 ET (13:33 GMT). Increased Bitcoin buying by world no.1 corporate holder Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ), did little to buoy prices. The Michael Saylor-led firm purchased about 4,048 Bitcoin for nearly $450 million in the last week of August. Elsewhere, digital tokens belonging to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto venture\u2013 World Liberty Financial\u2013 tumbled during debut in public markets earlier this week. The world\u2019s largest crypto had fallen to a two-month low of around $107,000 earlier in the week, leading broader declines in crypto markets. It had tumbled some 12% from a record high hit in mid-August. Bitcoin\u2019s recent losses also coincided with a sharp decline in Wall Street, as risk-driven assets were spooked by rising bond yields across major economies. Markets were on edge ahead of closely watched reading on the U.S. labor market this week, with nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday. Any signs of further deterioration in the labor sector could prime the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this month, although a weakening labor market also presents increased risks around the U.S. economy. Weak purchasing managers index readings for August furthered this notion. Still, markets maintained an over 90% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, CME Fedwatch showed. Uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs also weighed, after an appeals court ruled that most President Donald Trump\u2019s trade levies were illegal, and will need to be withdrawn by October 14. Trump signaled that he will appeal the decision with the Supreme Court, adding to the list of ongoing legal challenges faced by his administration. Trump\u2019s attempts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook were also met with legal resistance, with the case likely to head to the top U.S. court. Bitcoin largely tracks U.S. technology stocks, and had fallen in tandem with the NASDAQ Composite in recent sessions. Rising bond yields across the globe, amid concerns over stretched government debt levels in the developed world, spooked traders. Some crypto assets can now be traded with the joint approval of both U.S. market watchdogs, according to a Tuesday statement from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The agencies said that registered platforms under their oversight are permitted to handle such products. The move marks a sharp departure from the cautious approach of the prior administration. Under President Donald Trump, a vocal supporter of the industry and an increasingly active participant through his family business, regulators have acted quickly to open the door for digital assets to enter the existing financial framework. The SEC and the CFTC said they are \u201ccoordinating efforts to facilitate the trading of certain spot crypto asset products on registered exchanges.\u201d Their work \u2014 the SEC\u2019s \u201cProject Crypto\u201d and the CFTC\u2019s \u201ccrypto sprint\u201d \u2014 is aimed at fulfilling Trump\u2019s directive to establish the U.S. as a leading hub for digital assets. According to the agencies, CFTC-registered designated contract markets, foreign boards of trade, and SEC-registered national securities exchanges \u201care not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot crypto asset products.\u201d They encouraged those entities to reach out to staff for guidance. \u201cMarket participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,\u201d SEC",

      "clean_text": "The V11 group are campaigning for a change in the law to protect victims of crime from serious tax charges Three parliamentarians are calling for an investigation into the case of a group of former Premier League players who say they were victims of \"financial abuse\". Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Rod Wallace are part of the V11 campaign group, which comprises 11 footballers who invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. The players lost tens of millions of pounds and some now owe millions in tax. Lord Mann, Alex Sobel MP and Sarah Bool MP said the case was \"a failure of regulation, accountability and duty of care\". They were speaking in response to the BBC documentary Football's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11, which aired on Tuesday. David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who ran Kingsbridge, have denied any wrongdoing. They told the BBC: \"At all times Kingsbridge advised in good faith and set out the risks and opportunities both before and after any investment was agreed.\" Former footballers lost millions in investments Football\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Financial Shame: The Story of the V11 Up to 200 footballers may have been affected, with some losing their homes and being made bankrupt. \"This was not a case of greed or bad decisions,\" said the cross-party parliamentarians. \"These men did what we ask of everyone - they saved for their futures, trusted regulated professionals and followed advice they believed was sound. \"We believe that these victims have been failed by not only their advisers but also the financial services sector, by regulatory and law enforcement bodies, by HMRC, and by the football industry.\" City of London Police opened an investigation in 2018. Two years later it was closed, with the force concluding there was \"insufficient evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction\". No charges were brought against Kingsbridge staff. Lord Mann, Sobel and Bool have called for \"a thorough investigation into the conduct of all advisers and schemes involved\" and \"a fair and timely resolution to the decade-long tax dispute\". Bool said she wants \"to see a leniency package put in place by HMRC\" for the V11 group. In a statement HMRC said: \"We have a duty to collect tax when it is legally due. \"We recognise that dealing with an enquiry and a large tax liability can be stressful and we are absolutely committed to identifying and supporting customers who need extra help.\"",
